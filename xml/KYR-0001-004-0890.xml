   <p>State of Kentucky, Jessamine County Sc<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi></p>
<p>Personally appeared before me a Justice of the peace within and for said State and County Mastin Hunter who states on oath That in this case in the Jessamine Circuit Court for permitting Gaming upon his premise described in the petition hereto, That at the time and place mentioned by the Witness in the trial of said Hunter in the Circuit Court of this county <date when="1864-03">March 1864</date> said Hunter and others of his neighbors did play cards but there was nothing bet, lost or won and that they were playing for amusement, And he verily beleives that the witness (Brumfield) was influenced by spite illwill and malice which caused him to give the evidence before the Jury he did in order to be revenged on him (Hunter) for making ^Brumfield^ pay a debt to him (Hunter). That at the same Term of the same Court he was fined sixty dollars for keeping a Tippling house upon the testimony of the same person alone, that the same animus prevailed with Brumfield in both cases. that he ^Hunter^ is a distiller and has never sold Whiskey in less quantities than the law allows him to sell, nor has he ever at any time permitted tippling or drinking upon his premises, that the fine against him is for selling whiskey in less quantities than the Law allows, he denies and says he has not so sold whiskey or any other intoxicating liquor. -- </p>
<p>The payment of the fines mentioned or either of them would add greatly to his already embarrassed condition that he has a large a growing and helpless family entirely dependent upon him for support, and he humbly and respectfully requests the Honorable Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> <unclear/> Governor of Kentucky to exercise executive clemency<unclear/> petitioner.</p>

<p>To His Excelency Go<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">v</hi></hi> Bramlette</p>
<p>Your undersigned petitioners state that thay are citizens of Jessamine County. and ware of the Jury that tried the case of the Commonwealth against Mastan Hunter upon Indict<hi rend="underline">mt</hi> for suffering Gameing at the <date when="1864-03">March term of the Jessamine Circuit Court 1864</date>. -- Upon the trial of said case it was proven by one witness only. that upon one occasion he saw Mastan Hunter and others playing cards in the Still House of said Hunter and upon said Game a treat was bet won and lost. Theer was some Contrariety of testimony, but under the proof and the instruction of the Court your petitioners felt constrained to find the defendant guilty and we assessed his fine at <hi rend="str">the</hi> ^200^ the least some we had a right to do under the law. Your petitioners however believe that M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hunters case demands. Exectative Clemency and interposition, We would therefore aske your Excelency to remit the ^said^ fine against Mastin Hunter and your petitioners will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
