        <p>Camp Boone was established in early July, 1861 in Montgomery County, Tennessee. The camp was located about seven-eight miles north of Clarksville, Tennessee, near the Kentucky-Tennessee state line, and in the summer of 1861 served as a rendezvous and camp of instruction for Kentucky soldiers from Harrison, Scott, Fayette, Boone, Franklin, Bourbon, Kenton and other counties who were looking to enlist in the Confederate army. The camp location was selected by Brigadier General W.T. Withers, a Kentucky native and Mexican American war veteran, who was organizing a brigade of Kentuckians for service in the Confederate army.</p>
