<lb/>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas E. Bramlette</persName>.<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Believing as I do that you have deeply at heart the interest peace and welfare of our State, I am prompted to lay before you as briefly as possible a <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State</orgName>ment as follows: -- </p>
<p>You are doubtless aware of the difficulty pending between<persName ref="cwgk:N00009472"> The Akins</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00005395">Lincoln</placeName> &amp; the <persName ref="cwgk:N00009473">Rouseys</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002353">Boyle</placeName> -- As I understand, the Akin party applied for and obtained a commission to recruit a company for the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000870">State Service</orgName> -- which was probably well Enough -- </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards -- the other party (Rouseys) <hi rend="str">N</hi>Applid for a commission and was promptly refused, -- which was we think also well enough -- <pb/></p>
<p>Rouseys failing to obtain a commision in their own Name -- Sent forward to you an Uncle from I think <placeName ref="cwgk:P001017">Adair County</placeName> -- One <persName ref="cwgk:N00009470">Capt Curry</persName>, formerly of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009471">13 Ky</orgName></p>
<p>If I am correctly informed -- both parties are now organizing rapidly and unless your Excelency can do some thing for the people of the immediate country in which they live -- fears are entertained that it will grow into something awful indeed -- </p>
<p>Rest assured there is even now a reign of terror among those people who so well know the material of which the parties are composed- and especially the <hi rend="underline">Rouseys</hi> -- </p>
<p>Wishing that you may be enabled to spare some little time to a careful investigation of this matter -- and act in the case as your good judgment may dictate</p>
<p>I am Sir
<lb/>Your Obedient Servant -- 
<lb/>"<hi rend="underline">Peace</hi>"<pb/></p>
