Your Petitioner ^would state that the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">late Governor</persName>^ respited this fine for 12 months and Your Petitioner has paid the costs and did hope to be able to pay the fine before the 12 months expired tho he finds that now it will be impossible to do so as he has a <persName ref="cwgk:N00017640">wife</persName> and four children to support all young and one that is totally helpless and the business house and dwelling house in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002553">Lebanon</placeName> Ky has been passed and taken from him by the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">Federal</orgName> officers and thereby threw him out of business and deprived him of the means to support his family and he cannot pay the fine and putting him in jail would not pay the fine<pb/>
