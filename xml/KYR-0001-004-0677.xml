   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette Gov. of Kentucky -- The undersigned, would respectfully represent that at the present <date when="--04">(April) Term</date> of the Breckinridge Circuit Court two judgments were rendered by said court in favour of the Comlth against Theophilus C Leslie for &#36;50 each for selling spirits to minors -- The proof in the first case was that the consent of the Step Father &amp; the Mother had been given but was not in writing as required by the statute- No question was permitted to go to the Jury but the fact of selling &amp; the age of the young man &amp; the consequence was a conviction- In the second case Defendant was prepared to make the same proof but knowing it to be inadmissable under the ruling of the Court he confessed the Judg<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for &#36;50 -- We are satisfied that the Indictments had been gotten up in malice- These were the first ones of the kind ever found in this County &amp; the Defendant acted in ignorance of the law -- The minors were of <hi rend="str">one age &amp; </hi>size &amp; appearance that would have made it doubtful whether they were of age or not and under all the circumstances we feel satisfied that this is a proper case for execution Clemency -- Wherefore we pray your Excellency to interpose in behalf of Deft to the extent authorised by law -- </p>
