<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Hon J F Robinson
</persName><lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> Ky <lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>I write you at the request of some of the most earnest and <hi rend="underline">practical</hi> Loyal men of this county requesting <hi rend="underline">if</hi> <hi rend="underline">practical</hi>- that about 100- efficient mounted men be kept in this county for some days- or until those now engaged in recruiting for the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Confederate rebels</orgName>- shall be caught or routed-This has been going on with <hi rend="str">an</hi> a remarkable activity- being adjacent to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001509">Trimble</placeName> and <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004760">owen</placeName>- they have had a pretty clear <unclear/>- I have had since here a fair opertunity to hear and learn and I assure you sir this is no <hi rend="underline">hobgoblin</hi>- but an actuality- and the <persName ref="cwgk:N00008704">rebel Jessee</persName>- we thought killed has been<pb/>
<lb/>successfully at work here up to last Sunday night- There are many hiding places on the border of Owen- and Trimble and many think he is yet skulking here. The few union men of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001509">Trimble</placeName> have been agrieved by the uneven and the untimely action of <persName ref="cwgk:N00009447">Dickens</persName> a <hi rend="underline">Provost</hi> from this county who in a mistaken zeal (to say the least) has given to the recruiting Rebels a new impulse- and it is telling in the number of recruits- The troops now here- under <persName ref="cwgk:N00009475">Holman</persName> we have not heard from- but they were too late for the Locality they were sent to- This place should be the head quarters- and work out from here in squads- There are a number of efficient men here to cooperate with them but some permanent organization is necessary as a neucles for them-</p>
<p>I do hope my dear sir that your health will be equal to the demands that are upon you and that God will favor this commonwealth in a kind providence over you, and this is the prayer of scores<pb/>
<lb/>and hundreds of loyal hearts all over this land -- <persName ref="cwgk:N00009446">Mrs B</persName> joins in regards to you-</p>
<p>Respectfully
