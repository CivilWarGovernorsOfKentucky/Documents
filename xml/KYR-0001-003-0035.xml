<lb/>CIRCULAR.</p>
<p>It is directed by General Orders, No. 376, current series, from the War Department, that re-enlisted Volunteers, returned to their States, shall report, through the Governor, to the Superintendent of the Volunteer Recruiting Service.</p>
<p>When officers and men so report, the respective Governors and Superintendents should arrange to place such as can be profitably employed on Recruiting Service, on that duty; the others to be furloughed for the time authorized by General Orders, No. 376.</p>
<p>When furloughs are granted, they must be signed by the Superintendent, who will direct <hi rend="italic">that at the expiration of the time granted, the parties furloughed shall report at a stated rendezvous, else be considered deserters.</hi></p>
<p>Superintendents will arrange, under existing regulations, for the transportation and subsistence of those placed on duty.</p>
<p>Upon the assembling of the Veteran Volunteers at the rendezvous, after the expiration of the furloughs, Superintendents will report the respective commands (regiments, companies, or detachments) to the <persName ref="cwgk:N00005245">Adjutant General of the Army</persName>, for orders. The reports will give the strength of the command; -- the number of recruits for it, obtained during the furlough, to be stated separately.</p>
<p>In returning the Volunteers to the field, the Superintendents will arrange with the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00013213">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> for the necessary transportation.</p>
<p>Superintendents will confer with the Governors, and arrange with them as to the points of rendezvous for the Volunteers herein referred to. The rendezvous must be at points where there are already public barracks or quarters; and if the accomodation are not sufficient for the number to rendezvous thereat, the Quartermaster's Department, on the requisition of the Superintendent, will supply the deficiency.</p>
<p>At the respective rendezvous, the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018202">Subsistence Department</orgName> will be charged with the subsistence of the troops. The Superintendents will advise the Subsistence Department of the number of troops that will have to be supplied.</p>
