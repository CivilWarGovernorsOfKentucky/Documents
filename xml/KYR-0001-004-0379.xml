<p>Governor Bramlette,</p>
<p>A Prof- of one of our Medical schools, in company with the Janitor of the school, in the night time Entered <hi rend="str">a grave yard</hi> ^the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00012622">Potters field</orgName> of the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">city</placeName> ^ &amp; took thereupon the body of a pauper, &amp; negro man,- and on their way to the school, were, arrested by policeman, A Judgment was rendered as stated in the petition. I have carefully thought about this matter, and believe that although the statute was violated- it has been vindicated- and considering the absolute necessity for this Flourishing school, to<pb/>
<lb/>have subjects for dissection for the diffusion of science in the proffession being taught by the Profs. I respectfully ask for a remission</p>
<p>Respectfully

<p>We earnestly hope his excellency Gov Bramlette will remit the above mentioned fine</p>
<p>It seems to me that a more righteous case for the Governor's interposition could not be presented. All the facts are well known to me.</p>
