   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramblett Gov. of the Commonwealth of Ky. your petitioner Samuel Mitchell would most respectfully state that at the <date when="1864-10">last October Term </date> of the Fleming Circuit Court, a Judgment was rendered against him for &#36;50. in favor of the Commonwealth, upon an Indictment found by the Grand Jury at the <date when="1863-09">September Term 1863,</date> upon the evidence of John Rickets, for an alledged Assault made upon Said Rickets, about the <date when="1863-09-01"> first of September 1863,</date> upon the trial the petitioner plead not guilty, but the jury found him guilty &amp; brought in a verdict of &#36;50. for which the Judgt was rendered, Petitioner was greatly Surprised at the evidence of said Rickets who Swore that the petitioner assaulted him as he was returning from court about the <date when="1863-09"> first of September 1863,</date> with a drawn pistol, and threatened to shoot him-petitioner could have proved by other witnesses who were present ^when the difficulty occurred^ but failed to have them Summoned believing that they were Summoned for the Commonwealth, &amp; was unable to get the case continued; yet he did not believe that Rickets would state what he did. He states that He was one of the Home Guard for his neighborhood, &amp; it produced considerable prejudice, against him by the Southern rights men of whom Rickets was one, &amp; going out from Town about the first of the <date when="1863-09">Sept. Term of the Court 1863,</date> he ^was^ overtaken ^by^ Rickets, &amp; a dispute took place ^between <hi rend="str">them</hi><hi rend="str"> <unclear/></hi>^ Rickets &amp; himself, &amp; some harsh language was used &amp; Rickets called him a liar several times, finally accused him of having a pistol &amp; petitioner said he did have one &amp; at the request of Rickets he drew the pistol from his left pocket with his left hand &amp; held it up with the muzzle up &amp; then put it in his pocket again, but made no assault<pb/>
<lb/>or attempt or threat to shoot or do said Rickets any injury -- He only used two witnesses on the trial but they were some little distance behind when the difficulty occurred, &amp; could not State Positively as to the assault. But there evidence conduced to show that no assault was made. He has taken the affidavits of several persons that were present, at the time all of whom Stated that no assault was made their affidavits are herewith filed as part hereof -- Besides the damages or fine was excessive &amp; show<hi rend="str">ed</hi>s some under influence in some way. He States that he is poor &amp; has a large family to support, &amp; was compelled to replevy the Judgment, &amp; it will soon be due &amp; if not released by your Excellency he will be compelled to pay it &amp; he says it is wholy unjust &amp; he believes that the facts of the case show Strong grounds for the interposition of your Excellency.</p>
<p>Wherefore he prays the interposition of your Excellency ^<hi rend="str">that said fine be</hi>^ &amp; remit<hi rend="str">ed</hi> said fine &amp; except the fees &amp; cost. in duty bound will ever pray.</p>
