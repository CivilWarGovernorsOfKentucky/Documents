<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>I have learned, with some surprise recently, that a minister of the gospel named Fairbanks is still confined in the penitentiary, upon the charge of stealing a negro in Ky. He has been there for many years, having first been convicted in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001031">Fayette</placeName>, for the same offence, in which <persName ref="cwgk:N00011417">Miss Webster</persName> was sentenced. He was afterwards pardoned on the earnest intercession of his <persName ref="cwgk:N00011416">father</persName>, who lost his life in our midst, with cholera. He was again sent from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> on a similar charge some ten or twelve years ago, &amp; has<pb/>
<lb/>several years yet to suffer unless pardoned.</p>
<p>Now while high officials of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">U. S. Government</orgName> with the sanitation of the president or by his orders, are doing the same thing or much worse, under the tyrants state plea of "Military necessity," - without entertaining any such conscientious opinions as influenced Fairbanks. I think it a most cruel farce to keep him in penal confiement, &amp; hope you will pardon him.</p>
<p>Very truly
