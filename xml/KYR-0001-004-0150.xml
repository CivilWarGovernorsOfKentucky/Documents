<lb/>To His Excellency

<p>Your petitioner a resident of Trimble county would most respectfully represent that, he was fined fifteen Dollars and costs of suit about <date when="1863-06-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> June last</date> before Esquire John W Stewart a Justice of the peace for Trmble county for striking James M. Branch.</p>
<p>your peitioner does not deny striking said Branch; but was excited from the fact that Branch used very insulting language, and he supposed that he might strike him, hence the blow.</p>

<p>He further states hes sorry for his offence having been always a peacable well disposed person, he therefore prays your Honor to exercise that Clemency which his case Seems to demand and as in duty bound will every pray &amp;C &amp;C</p>
<p>J. Milton Moore<pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Trimble county join the petitioner J. Milton Moore in his prayer and pray you to remit said fine or so much thereof as in your clemency you may See fit &amp;C</p>
