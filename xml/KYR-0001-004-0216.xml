<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Gov. T. E. Bramlette</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Ransom Laswell would most respectfully ^state^ That at the last <date when="--08">August Term</date> of the Rockcastle circuit ^court^ he was fined &#36;20. &amp; costs for gaming with four others, Isaac Whitehead John Cable &amp; Albert Owens, all confessed Judgment. Whitehead &amp; Cable petitioned Gov. Robinson and was relieved and I do most respectfully ask that you extend the same relief to your humble petitioner Ransom Laswell, It was about my first gaming and I promise it, to be my last. The game was for amusement more than profit, only bet 5 cts a game for a few games, hope you will remit the fine, as any little fine in my circumstances would bear heavily upon me,</p>
<p>I am Respectfully your humble Petitioner
<lb/>Ransom Laswell</p>
<p>We the undersigned are well acquainted with M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Laswell and his circumstances know him to be an honest upright and good citizen a poor man, and this is the first we ever heard of his gaming, and as this little fine would embarrass him we would be highly gratified, if consistent with your sense of duty to see it remitted.</p>
