   <p>To <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor Thomas E Bramlette</persName></p>
   <p>The undersigned would respectfully State to your Excellency that at the <date when="1864-10">late October term</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000489">Pendleton Circuit Court</orgName> a judgment was rendered against <persName ref="cwgk:N00003633">Jacob Fogle</persName> upon the forfeited recognizance of <persName ref="cwgk:N00003630">Daniel Fogle</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00003638">Mahalo Fogle</persName>, which recognizance was executed before <persName ref="cwgk:N00003640">R. F. Colvin</persName> Esq a Justice of the peace for <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000544">Said County</placeName> during the pending of proceedings before him under a peace warrant against Said Daniel and Mahalo Fogle issued at the instance of one <persName ref="cwgk:N00004861">P. F. Allen</persName>. Before the trial on Said Bond in the Circuit Court. Said Allen and Daniel &amp; Mahalo Fogle had compromised and Settled all difference between them. with the understanding that none of them Should appear in Said Court neither to prosecute or defend. Under these circumstances relying upon the good faith of the parties, and believing that the afore Said parties had the legal right to Settle Said difficulty <persName ref="cwgk:N00003633">Jacob Fogle</persName> made no effort to Secure the attendance of those for whom he was responsible. Besides at the time <persName ref="cwgk:N00003630">Daniel Fogle</persName> was a soldier in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">United States army</orgName> which he believed would exonerate him as Surety from liability if Said Compromise did not, Consequently he failed to take Such Steps as the law required him to take. Said judgment was rendered agst <persName ref="cwgk:N00003633">Jacob Fogle</persName> for the Sum of fifty dollars. Mr Fogle is a quiet peaceable and industrious citizen but a man with a large family to Support with very limited means to do So. From our knowledge of Mr Fogle we believe that he acted in good faith in the premises as above Stated. And we believe that if your Excellency would remit Said judgment to the extent that you are authorized to do. it would be a generous Commendable act of kindness we therefore respectfully ask your Excellency to remit said<pb/>
<lb/>judgment agst Said <persName ref="cwgk:N00003633">Jacob Fogle</persName> if consistent with your Sense of duty and right. <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000550">Falmouth Ky</placeName> <date when="1864-11-26">Nov 26th 1864</date>.</p>
