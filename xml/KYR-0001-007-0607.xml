<lb/><hi rend="str">M</hi>Hon Gov Bramllett
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>I have been solicited by numerous pensioners in My county Kenton Co. Ky to get appointed a Notary Public = as it is very inconvenient for pensions to go to a justice of the P<hi rend="str">l</hi>eace &amp; then to Independence to get the seal of the clerk of the court &amp; as a Notary is recognized with only his seal of office it would accomodate many persons</p>
<p>If you have no objection &amp; will Send me the form of bond &amp;c I will make the application=</p>
<p>I remain very respectfully
<lb/>Your obt sert
<lb/>John. W. Oneal

<p>We have Known Mr Jno W. Oneal for about three years &amp; find him honest &amp; trustworthy &amp; we think competent for any business which would come in his way of the kind more so than a majority of Justices of the Peace who sometimes mangle things up terribly = <unclear/> We have been solicited by several to have him appointed &amp; he is himself very indifferent about it = Says it will be no profit to him but if he is appointed will do the best he can to assist such persons=</p>
<p>Hoping to hear a favorable answer from you, we remain very
<lb/>Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt sert
