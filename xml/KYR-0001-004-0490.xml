   <p>To his Excellency T. E. Bramlett, Govenor of the State of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The petition of the Subscribers, citizens of Lyon County, respectfully Showith: That one Issac Skimmerhorn, at the <date when="1859-10">October term 1859</date> of the Lyon Circuit Court, was endicted for the crime of felony, and at the <date when="1860-06">June term 1860</date>, the Said Skimmerhorn was admitted to bail in the Sum of Two Hundred and Fifty dollars, whereupon he executed Bond to the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the aforesaid sum of Two Hundred and Fifty dollars, with Elias Smith and W. J. Smith as his Sureties, for his appearance at the next term (<date when="1860-12">Dec 1860</date>) of the Court. And said Skimmerhorn, failing to make his appearance as required by said Bond at the said <date when="1860-12">Dec term 1860</date> the said Bond was taken as forfeited, and at the <date when="1863-12">Dec term 1863</date>, Judgement was rendered upon the said Bond, against John W. Clark, the administrator of said Elias Smith, for the sum of <hi rend="underline">One</hi> <hi rend="underline">Hundred and</hi> <hi rend="underline">Twenty</hi> <hi rend="underline">five</hi> <hi rend="underline">dollars</hi>. Just after the bail Bond was taken as forfeited the Said W. J. Smith over<hi rend="str">haul</hi> hauled the said Skimmerhorn and delivered him to the Jailor of Said county, and Sometime after this, the Said Skimmerhorn broke the jail and fled to Illinois, where report <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> says he died. The individual debts of Elias Smith ^are^ quite small, but his Security debts amount to thousands of dollars, and will consume the greater part of his estate. That Elias Smith befriended many poor men of this county, who were Striving to get along, there is no doubt, and for So=doing his estate now has to Suffer<pb/></p>
<p>Your petitioners therefore pray your Excellancy to exercise your executive clemency in behalf of said estate, and that your Excellancy remit the Said Judgement, or So much thereof as may be deemed just and proper.</p>
