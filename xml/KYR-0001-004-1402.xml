  <body>
   <p>To Governor Thomas E Bramlette,</p>
<p>Your petitioners the undersigned would most respectfully state that at the <date when="1864-10">late October</date> term of the Pendleton Circuit a judgment was rendered against Rebecca and Adam Jacobs for the Sum of twenty five dollars as Sureties upon the forfeited recognizance of John Jacobs which bond was executed before F F Wallace a justice of the peace for Said County in a proceeding under a peace warrant which isued at the instance and request of one Jerry Sheehan and wife. The circumstances attending the above proceedings are about these Said Sheehan and wife conceived that they had reason to fear some great bodily harm at the hands of John Jacobs and caused said warrant to be issued and had him held over to appear before the Pendleton Circuit Court with Adam and Rebecca Jacobs as his Sureties: the same proceedings were had at the same time against said Sheehan at the instance of John Jacobs. and he also was held for his appearance in Said Court at the Same time. But before the sitting of Said Court said parties towit Sheehan and John Jacobs became friendly and compromised all difficulties between each agreeing to pay his own cost and that he would not appear in said Court to testify against the other -- this was done before Said recognizance was returned by the Justice thereupon they were informed that Said Bonds would not be returned -- and John Jacobs Sureties towit Said Adam &amp; Rebecca<pb/>
<lb/>were informed by those in whose judgement and knowledge they had confidence that the parties aforesaid had the legal right to compromise their difficulty and that would be no use for their principal to attend in Said Court because the difficulty was fully and legally adjusted and for this reason he did not attend wherefore the judgment against them.</p>
<p>Adam &amp; Rebecca Jacobs and also their principal John Jacobs are persons of very limited intellectual acquirements <hi rend="str">being</hi> ^and^ of German birth and education wholly ignorant of the forms and requirements of the laws of Kentucky. They are also persons of very little or no property and Should they be compelled to pay even the Small Sum of twenty five dollars they will thereby be deprived of what little Subsistence they have -- They are quiet and peaceable citizens We therefore ask your Excellency if Consistent with your Sense of duty and right to remit the judgment against them so far as by law you are authorized to do. <date when="1864-12-17">December 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date>.</p>
