<lb/>Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Bramlette</persName>
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
   <p>I enclose an attested copy of an Indictment pending in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000404">Hart Circuit Court</orgName> against <persName ref="cwgk:N00020739">James Vance</persName> for horse stealing. Vance has fled from Justice, and is now located in the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004765">State of </placeName><orgName ref="cwgk:O00014696"><placeName ref="cwgk:P00004765">Illinois</placeName></orgName>. I wish ^you^ to make the usual requisition upon the <persName ref="cwgk:N00006923">Governor</persName> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00014696">Illinois</orgName> for his arrest and delivery to the Authorities of this state.</p>
<p>He is rather a notorious thief, and a bad man and ought to be punished</p>
<p>A <persName ref="cwgk:N00019926">M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton</persName> whose mare was stolen has ascertained the County in which Vance is now located in Illinois. And I suggest that you appoint Mr McHatton the agent of the State to receive the fugitive.</p>
<p>If you will make such appointment, he (M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton,) will take the requisition papers in person to the Governor of Illinois. And attend the officers of that State, receive the fugitive &amp; bring him to Kentucky. The appointment of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton would I know be a good appointment<pb/>
<lb/>I know him well, and testify that he is prudent and sensible, Does not seek the position, for any improper motive, will not in any way mistrust the prisoner, but simply desires that he should be brought to Justice, and not longer evade the law.</p>
<p>The Post Office address of Mr M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton is Bacon Creek <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003019">Hart County</placeName>, you can send the papers directly to him or forward them to me as your may prefer, &amp; I can send them to him</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;C,
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00005301">W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> B. Jones</persName><pb/></p>
