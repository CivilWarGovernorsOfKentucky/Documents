<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000889">Fulton Station Ky</placeName>.<lb/><date when="1861-05-29">May 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date>,
<lb/>To Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Cheatham Commanding forces at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000899">Union City
</placeName><lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>I have just been informed that several large cannon are now en route for <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000893">Columbus Ky</placeName>, said to have been sent up from <placeName ref="cwgk:P001003">Memphis Tenn</placeName>. and that a force of several hundred men is now collecting to <unclear>plant</unclear> them, and that to day and to night, is the time selected for such purpose. I hope sir that you will arrest this enterprise and not permit either men, or the guns in question, or munitions of war of any kind to be sent to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName> without ^the consent^ of the regularly constituted authorit<hi rend="str">y</hi>ies, but that you will respect the position Ky has assumed, of neutrality, and prevent as far as it may be in your power to do so the rules of good neighborhood, under the circumstances surrounding us now, from being departed from.</p>
<p>I am not a military man, but I do think it would be highly impolitic to send forward the cannon without an adequate force to protect them. I refer you to a copy of note to the Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N00003328">Jno A Gardner</persName>, Confidential agent of His Excellency the Governor of Tennesse, which is herewith sent.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be very Respectfully
<lb/>(signed)<persName ref="cwgk:N00003952"> Jno M Johnson</persName></p>
