<lb/>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Gov. Robinson</persName>
<lb/>Executive of Kentucky &amp;c
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>It is not a common thing with me to intermeddle myself with the proceedings of legal courts, or even to throw, even a suggestion obstacle, in the way of free &amp; equal justice. But learning that the Jury, -- or most of them, -- in the case of <persName ref="cwgk:N00019640">Montgomery</persName>, -- recently convicted of Homicide &amp; sentenced to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName> for the term of two years, have petitioned your Excellency for his Pardon, I would respectfully urge the same thing. Montgomery has been a member of the Church over which I preside, for many years &amp; has enjoyed the confidence of the community, as a modest &amp; honest man. We do not think that he <hi rend="underline">intended</hi> the crime, of which he stands convicted, &amp; feel will assured his incarceration in the Prison, at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>, -- though demanded by Law, -- would not meet the ends of Justice. We hope your Excellency will listen to the Prayer of your Petitioners &amp; grant the Pardon asked for</p>
<p>Very respectfully &amp;c
