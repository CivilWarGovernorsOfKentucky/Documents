<lb/>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Tho's. E. Bramlette</persName>:<lb/>Sir:</p>
<p>I herewith transmit to you, a petition in behalf of <persName ref="cwgk:N00002586">W. H. Brown</persName>, a citizen of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002312">Webster county</placeName>, Not being known to your Excellency, no statement of mine could add any force to the petition -- but many of the signers are doubtless known to you, as among the truest and most respectable men of that section of the state, I will say only that from confidential communication with Brown, as his counsel, I am satisfied that the statements of the petition are literally true,</p>
<p>The reason for seeking your<pb/>
<lb/>Excellency's interposition now, rather than after trial, is that it would be a social misfortune for such a man as Brown, and for his family, to bear the stigma of his conviction for a felony, for an act so done, as this the signers of his petition show that the best of the community would so regard it, </p>
<p>Will your Excellency be kind enough to inform me of your determination touching this petition</p>
<p>With high consideration</p>
<p>Your obt Servant
