S. Buford </persName>who as a member of the grand Jury preferred the charge upon which the indictment was found- <hi rend="str">The absence of W S Buford</hi>. These persons all Know the slave- Some of them are trustees of Midway and one a justice of the peace. The hemp seed were paid for in money,</p>
<p>D. B. Price</p>
