   <p>To <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor Thomas E Bramlette</persName></p>
   <p>The undersigned citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000550">Falmouth</placeName> and <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000544">Pendleton County</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName> would most respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the <date when="1865-04">April</date> term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000489">Pendleton Circuit Court</orgName> just closed in the case of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky</orgName> agst <persName ref="cwgk:N00010849">Polly Southgate</persName>, the defendant was found guilty of permitting her Slave to go at large and hire him self, and his fine fixed at forty dollars. -- The circumstances are about these, The Said Polly Southgate is a free woman of Color and the slave so permitted to go at large is by the name of <persName ref="cwgk:N00010814">Caleb</persName> and both her husband and Slave. He makes a living for himself and family by engaging in Such jobs of work as he can get to do in and around Falmouth and the earnings of his labor so performed are the only means of Support for himself and family; And it was for in permitting Caleb to engage in these jobs in his own behalf that Said Polly was indicted and found guilty</p>
<p>We are Satisfied that there was no intent of violating law but that Said Caleb was so permitted to go at large and hire himself solely for the purpose of raising means to Support his family on -- and that both he and his wife and witnesses acted in good faith in the matter, Should she be required to pay the full amount of said fine. She will be compelled to sell her Slave and husband to do so. and will then be without any means of Support whatever<pb/>
<lb/>for herself and children of which there are several who are too Small to earn any thing for themselves We personally knowing the above detailed facts would most earnestly request your Excellency to remit said fine so far as by law, you are authorized <hi rend="str">by law</hi> to do. if not inconsistent with your Sense and feelings of right and justice.</p>
