<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>The <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor</persName> of the State of Ky, </p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent that on the <date when="1861-10-12">12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of October 1861</date> he Joined at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000446">Camp Kenton</placeName> Mason Co Ky the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00008605">16<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Regemint Ky Vol. Infantry</orgName> Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00009896">Charles A, Marshall</persName> Since which time he has been serving with Said Regiment except when on detached service, The testimonials of all the Field and <hi rend="str">l</hi>Line Officers of the Regiment can be procured certifying that I have always cheerfully and promptly discharged all the duties devolved upon me either in the capacity of a soldier or otherwise, ^,and speaking of my capacity to perform all duties of an officer^ During my connection with the Regt, I have at various times been connected with the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000389">Quarter-masters Dept</orgName>, and with the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000748">Head Quarters of Commandants of Brigades</orgName> in the capacity of Clerk and have thus obtained a tolerable knowledge of the routine and minutiae of military matters, I am <hi rend="str">an</hi>or was <hi rend="str">a Lawyer</hi> at the breaking<pb/>
<lb/>of this rebellion a practicing Lawyer in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000538">Flemingsburg</placeName> Ky, I am heart &amp; soul in favor of putting the traitors down; and I want to go where I can do most to aid in this much to be desired end. I honestly believe that if I had the proper authority I could recruit one or more companies of men to go to make up the Twenty thousand promised by our noble state. What I desire to know is what steps to take to procure such authority; and for this reason I have presumed to address you, It is Evident that if I can enlist 100 men for service that I will be doing more good than as a single individual in the ranks. I confess that I have ambition but it is a laud<hi rend="str">l</hi>able one that of seeing rebellion crushed and our country at peace once more I am a maternal nephew of your county man <persName ref="cwgk:N00012818">Joseph B. Kenney</persName> and would refer you to him</p>
<p>Any favor which you may be pleased to do me in this matter will be remembered with gratitude May I hope to hear from you on the subject at an early day.</p>
