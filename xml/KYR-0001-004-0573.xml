   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Powel County &#125; Ss:</p>
<p>The affiant J. H. Scholl, being duly sworn, says that he is the clerk of the Circuit Court for the County &amp; State aforesaid. That he knows Mr W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen well, and knows him to be a Union man, and ^one^ of the <hi rend="underline">most law-abiding</hi> citizens of this County, as well as one of the <hi rend="underline">most respectable</hi>. That he is a man of <hi rend="underline">moderate means</hi>, and within a short time has been compelled to pay a good deal as security for other men. That under the circumstances it would be a "hard case" were he compelled to pay the Recognizance forfeited against him &amp; W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> S. Stone as the Bail for H. Bowen, and two Sons, and Robert Wilbourne, the latter being now, according to common report, either in the Confederate Army, or else has died somewhere in Rebeldom. That the Bail of each of the defendants was set at Five Hundred Dollars.</p>
