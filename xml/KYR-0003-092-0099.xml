</placeName><lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Received this morning your favor of the <date when="1861-05-22">22<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> </date> -- Without consultation with <persName ref="cwgk:N00008151">Mr Higgins</persName> can give you no positive answers although from conversations had with him I may safely say he would prefer almost any other security to Bank stock as he is now over stocked with it. However I will be in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001838">Georgetown</placeName> on Monday next and will then settle the whole affair with you.</p>
<p>I have had an interview with John Allen Higgins in relation to the offset upon<pb/>
<lb/>the note. He denies the existence of any off-set and says he will make no arrangement allowing it. You and I can however settle the remainder and I shall file a reply requiring J. A. H. to interplead between yourself and my client-- You two can then settle it between you, as to which it liable for the amount of the off-set.</p>
<p>I have no doubt on a personal interview I can arrange the remainder above the offset to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>Very Truly Yours &amp; c 
<lb/>Frank. Waters.<pb/></p>
