<p><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E Bramlette</persName> Govener of the State of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>; Your Petitioner would respectfully represent; that on the <gap/> day of <date when="1863">1863</date>; He became the Bail of one <persName ref="cwgk:N00011641">Frank Yocum</persName> for the appearance of said Yocum at the <date when="1863-10">October Term</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName>; to answer two indictments for the Larceny of two old-trunks: ^and some articles of womens apparel^ said to have been stolen from <persName ref="cwgk:N00011642">Eleonora Hill</persName>; and <persName ref="cwgk:N00011643">Sarah Bell</persName>: each of whom are notorious prostitutes; and Keepers of houses of prostitution in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001028">City of Louisville</orgName>: That at the calling of the two cases: the said Defendant Yocum failed to answer, and a forfeiture of your petitioners Bonds for $400.00 ^in^ each ^case^ was taken in favor of the State of Kentucky ^on the <date when="1863-10-19">19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of October 1863</date>^. Your Petitioner could not produce said Yocum in Court; Because he was at that time, on his way back to or in his native country of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001022">Germany</placeName> where He is now as your Petitioner is informed and believes; Your Petitioner, says that He is informed and believes that from the threats and conduct of the prosecuting witnesses and their hangers-on said Yocum became alarmed and fled the country:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner says that Yocum has lived in<pb/>
<lb/>and about this city for several years and his occupation was that of a Cultivater of flowers He attended to flowers and shrubbery in the grounds that surrounded the houses of Several of our Citizens: and made the impression that He was an honest hearted and simple minded man. his wife for a long time sold flowers in the market, and your petitioner had made her acquaintance, most favorably, and by her entreaties and tears: He was induced to become the Bail of her husband the said Frank Yocum: not believeing him guilty of the charges made against him by the women mentioned a bove; nor does your petitioner believe now that He was guilty: but by reason of his being a simple and ignorant ^man^ He was scared away, when he considered the miserable characters of those who were prosecuting him, and were the witnesses against him:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner says, that He is not able <hi rend="str">to to state</hi> to pay the state these heavy amounts; and He submits to your Excellency to remit to him the said forfeitures; which <hi rend="str">are</hi> is grievous and ruinous to him; and the loss of which to the public: (which your petitioner has served long and laboriously, without adequate compensation) will not, feel: -- The premises considered He prays your Excellency to interpose the Executive clemency in his behalf: and save him from this unforseen and luckless misfortune<pb/>
except as to the clerks and Sheriffs fees and the fees to the Commonwealths Attorney</p>
