<lb/>Dear Uncle</p>
<p>I write to you at this time for the purpose of enlisting, you (if possible) in behalf of my friends friend</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00014013">Judge Fuquay</persName> who is my partner in business has a brother in law who is condemned to be hung at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002273">Princeton</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002472">Caldwell County</placeName> on the <date when="1861-03-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of March next</date> <gap/> The judge &amp; I both believe and we think from good ground, that his brother in Law, (<persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Wadlington</persName>) is condemed by false, yes basely false testimony.</p>
   <p>The jury in the case I am informed (and from such a source that I can not doubt it.) have <hi rend="underline">all</hi> signed a petition to the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Govenor</persName> to pardon or commute his punishment to confinement in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">penitentiary,</orgName> so have several hundred of the Citizens of Caldwell County and so have three to four hundred of the Citizens of this <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002615">County</placeName></p>
<p>Now Uncle you will at once see my object</p>
<p>It is to induce you to use your influence with the Govenor to pardon or commute the punishment.</p>
<p>I verrily believe that the prisenor ought to be pardoned.</p>
<p>If you are willing to use<pb/>
<lb/>your influence to this effect it will doubtless confer a favor on a <hi rend="str">wom</hi> woman who has been a faithful virtuous and good wife and three children (who will if the sentance of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000605">Court</orgName> is carried out) will be orphans in the full meaning of the word You will also confer a favor on your Nephew</p>
<p>The whole family so far as I Know is <hi rend="str">are</hi> in good health &amp; hope you are in the same condition</p>
<p>I would like much to hear from you on the reception of this</p>
<p>Your Nephew
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00013597">Sam C Woodson</persName></p>
<p>P S: The Petitions will be in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> by the <date when="1861-02-15">15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Feby</date> &amp; I think sooner If you think proper to use your influence please do so at the very earliest moment</p>
<p>Now Uncle I am in earnest in what I say about the matter &amp; believe I am doing a duty that I would be amiss in not doing</p>
<p>S C Woodson</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>If you can, consistant with right &amp; <hi rend="str">ho</hi> justice relieve the widow &amp; children from widowhood &amp; orphanage <hi rend="underline">indeed</hi> I Know it will do your heart good to do so &amp; it will be truly gratifying to <hi rend="str">me</hi> ^us^ to learn you feel free in doing so.</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00003280">Ben C Allin</persName>
