<lb/>Sister <persName ref="cwgk:N00010748">Maggie</persName></p>
<p>Your welcome letter of <date when="--02-26">Feb 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> has Just came to hands. I was glad to hear all was was well when you wrote except <persName ref="cwgk:N00010746">father </persName>I was very Sorry to hear that he was not well. I know he is getting old, and that he had worked ^very hard^; he had ^had^ a great deal of trouble to pass through in this life and ^I^ cannot but feel Sorry and tears Start involuntarily ^start^ from my eyes when I hear that he is not well. I hope he will be better when these lines reaches you. Your letter found me still in Hospital and in feeble health I do not know that I am any better than where I wrote you my last letter. I was so Sick a part of the day yesterday that I feinted. though I am feeling as well this morning, as I have for Several days. I wrote a letter to father and mother on <date when="1864-03-11">Friday last the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the present month</date>.</p>
<p>There is not much danger of my going into the Service again at the present time. but if I<pb/>
<lb/>Should get Stout I may posibly go into the Service again, but I would like to come home first, and see you all. if I can do so without fear, and be priviledged to go and come as I pleased. Otherwise I should not enjoy myself so well. I Should not like to endanger myself by coming home. The way Matters Stand there now it would not be very pleasant for me to come home unless I would have Liberty to go where I please. Whatever may have been my faults, I never was guilty of the charges prefered against me, and I feel myself even better than my perjured accusers. I have friends and have credit here; and have always had at any place, <hi rend="str">and</hi> where I have ever been. no man Stands higher for Honesty and integrity than I do in my company on <orgName ref="cwgk:O00010749">Regiment</orgName>. for this reason I Should not like to endanger myself by coming home. nothing though would give me more pleasure and Satisfaction than to come home to See <persName ref="cwgk:N00010798">mother </persName>and the rest of you. I have not made no great deal of money in the Service If my <persName ref="cwgk:N00010750">Captain </persName>had have lived I Should have made Something over three thousand dollars; as it is I have had<pb/></p>

<p>I Remain your most
<lb/>affectionate Brother
