   <p>To his Excellency, <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">T. E. Bramlette</persName> Govenor of the State of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName></p>
   <p>Your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00005557">C. C. Webb</persName> would respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the last Sept term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000411">Knox Circuit Court</orgName> 1863- he was indicted for permittg gaming in his house kept for a tavern in said county, and at the said term of the court, he confessed Judgment for the sum of two hundred dollars when he verily believes if he had tried the case he could have gotten clear of it. but whether he could or not. he implicitly reliers upon your Excellency to relieve him after your hear the statement of the facts. He says that two soldiers, who were at home on furloughs, <hi rend="str">p</hi>asked him if they might play a game of cards in the room. and he told them yes. but they must not play for any thing, and they said they would not, and he went off about his business. and directly he returned &amp; looked at them playing. but the witness to the indictment says that he saw the money under one of their thighs, and would show that your Petitioner was present-<pb/></p>
   <p>and at the time he confessed Judgment he thought that he could not get out of it. He says these are the facts in the case and he does think it very hard for him to pay that amout. He says that he is a very poor man with a family and <hi rend="str">i</hi>he is a shoe &amp; boot maker and has laboered very hard all his life to make what little he has, and Consequetly, he does think that if there ever was a case for Executive clemency this is one of them. He says that if your Excellency will remit this fine he and his family will bless him as long as he lives. He says that he is a cripple, and when Kentucky was invaded by <persName ref="cwgk:N00005618">Zollicoffer</persName>, he was one a mong the twenty four who fought the rebels at the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00005368">Barbourville</placeName> bridge- it being the first fight in Kentucky. He says that he does not speak of this in a boasting spirit, althogh if the citizens every where had done as they did there, this portion of Kentucky would never have been laid waste. but he speaks of it alone to show your Excellency that he has been loyal to his<pb/>
<lb/>government and although a cripple willing if need be to sacrifice his life for the good of his county. It is the intention that constitutes the crime and for that reason he does not think that he is guilty- If by a change in the affairs of life, I could be in your place, &amp; you in mine, and I knew the circumstances as well as I know it now- I would remit the fine and think that I was doing country good by so doing.</p>
