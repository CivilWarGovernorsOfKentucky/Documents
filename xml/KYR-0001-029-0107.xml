<lb/>To <persName ref="cwgk:N00002277">Mr John L Scott</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the instance of Mr <unclear>Gothelf</unclear> we enclose you some papers, relative to a petition to the <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Govenor</persName> signed by the Jurors who tried the case praying the Go<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">v</hi></hi> for the pardon of one <persName ref="cwgk:N00017301">Kaufman Kramer</persName>: It seems that the Governor declined at the instant because of having received a letter purporting to be from <persName ref="cwgk:N00017625">Cha<hi rend="sup">s</hi> L Stancliffe</persName> Chief of Police, of the City of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> from the representations in said Stancliffes letter, random statements were made: which if true <persName ref="cwgk:N00007393">Mr. Gothelf</persName> would feel mortified that he interposed and besought the pardon of this old man: but through your kindness He was enabled to get a copy of the aforesaid letter<pb/>
<lb/>and upon the exhibition of the letter to the Chief of Police: It turns out that it was written by a young man in Mr. Stancliffes office who gave what he had heard some one say about Kaufman Kremer: (possibly a vindictive Watch man:) M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Stancliffe upon examining into the matter ascertains that the rumors are not true &amp; withdraws the letter which was written to the Govenor: which said letter please find enclosed and by calling the attention of the Govnor ^to the same^ you will very much oblige</p>
<p>Yours 
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000948">Craig</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00000346">Elliott</persName></p>
