<lb/>His Excellency
    <lb/>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Jas F. Robinson</persName> Gov of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Ky</orgName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
   <p>I have seen the petition in circulation on behalf of <persName ref="cwgk:N00019378">Fielding M. Bush</persName>, recommending him to Executive Clemency, I rarely sign any petition, and when I do it must be under a firm conviction that there are extenuating circumstances surrounding the case &amp; that no outrage to public justice will ensue by the pardon of the Executive being granted</p>
   <p>The young man Fielding M Bush, whose case will be presented to you, is the son of <persName ref="cwgk:N00019380">Fielding Bush</persName> Esq of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001786">Clark Co</placeName>, who is one of our most respected citizens<pb/>
    <lb/>and noted for his having always heretofore been one of the conservative land marks of the County I learn that the young man Fielding M. Bush has voluntarily returned from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Southern Army</orgName> and surrendered himself to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">U S Military</orgName> commandant at <placeName ref="cwgk:P001002">Lexington</placeName> &amp; taken the oath of allegiance &amp; given the required bonds and is now at home, with the intention of remaining a peaceable &amp; law abiding person. He is quite a youth, and has been heretofore remarkable for his good behavior &amp; gentlemanly course, His case is one that presents many considerations for clemency, and his friends here believe, that if it is extended to him, that it <pb/>
    <lb/>will have a good effect in restoring others to the side of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">government</orgName>, who have been wavering or inclined to be against it.</p>
   <p>He is a relation of our worthy <persName ref="cwgk:N00000474">Senator Judge Bush</persName>, and he will not misrepresent him, when he <hi rend="str">stay</hi>states that he is a young man of fine impulses &amp; manly in his instincts &amp; of integrity of character</p>
<p>Your obt svt
