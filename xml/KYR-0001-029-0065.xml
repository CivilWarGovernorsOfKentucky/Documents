<lb/>His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">James F. Robinson</persName> - Govenor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Dear Sir-I take the liberty of appealing to you, as the chief majistrate of my native <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">State</placeName>, for protection, under the constitution and laws of the same. I was arrested at my own door in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002479">Russellsville</placeName>, Ky, on the <date when="--06-30">30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of June</date> last, was hurried to the Depot, and thense to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000560">Bowling Green</placeName>, where I was informed, by the <persName ref="cwgk:N00007424">officer</persName> in command, that I was charged with having been a rabbid, or prominant Secessionist, and with have <hi rend="str">served a</hi> ^acted as^ chairman of a "<orgName ref="cwgk:O00010203">Home Committee of Safety</orgName>" -- The first, I positively denied; the second, with some qualifycations, I admitted. From Bowling Green -- I was sent on to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName>, and from there to this prison. Up to this hour, I have had no oppertunity of making a defense, such, as I am evidently entitled to, as a citizen of Kentucky. Among my many friends, I have <hi rend="underline">some</hi> <hi rend="underline">enemies</hi> -- Hence, my presnt unhapy condition. There are favorable times for the development of private, personal anamosaties. No one can truthfully charge me with any want of veneration for the constitution of my country, with any lack of devotion to the <placeName ref="cwgk:P001802">Federal Union</placeName>, or with having believed in, or advocated the doctrine of Secession. No one more emphatically condemned, or more deeply deplored, the rash and reckless course of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001184">South Carolina</placeName> and the <unclear>Secessh</unclear> States, than I did myself. True, I was opposed to the war policy, for the preservation of the Union believing, as I did at the time, and as some of the present and best men of the country did, that there was perhaps, a "more excellent way," by which this greatest and most desirable of ^all^ earthly achievements might possibly have been attained, <hi rend="underline">without</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">sheading</hi> <hi rend="underline">of</hi> <hi rend="underline">human</hi> <hi rend="underline">blood</hi>! This is the sum of my offending, as far as my sentaments are involved. I never published an article, nor made a speech on the subject of our national difficulties -- I condoned but little in relation to those matters, and that, for the most part, in private, deploring the unhapy condition of the country -- If I ever cherished a disloyal sentament, uttered a disloyal word, or performmed a disloyal act, I am not conscious of having done so. Sure I am, that I have always intended to be loyal to my State and country, whatever may have been my views in relation to the policy of the administration. Respectiing my connection with the "Home Committee," I will only remark that I concented to serve as <pb/>
<lb/>a member of that Body, hoping that I might be instrumental in presenting said and in doing some good; and especially in protecting peaceable citizens, from the violence of misguided and reckless Southern citizens and soldiers -- And that this <hi rend="str">disnoble</hi> object was effected, to a greater or less extent, through the influence of the committe, all parties, <hi rend="underline">at</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">time</hi>, even free to admit -- and ^this fact^ can be established beyond the posability of a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>I am ready at anytime to give such pledges of loyalty, as may be deemed right and proper; and to bind myself to there faithful performance by such obligations, as may be required. <hi rend="underline">What</hi> <hi rend="underline">more</hi> <hi rend="underline">can</hi> <hi rend="underline">be</hi> <hi rend="underline">asked</hi>?</p>
<p>I am near sixty five years of age, am greatly worn by excessive mental and physical labors. My health at best is exceedingly feeble -- And if not released from the deprivations disabilities, and manifold afflictions of my present condition, I must soon <hi rend="str">sink</hi> come down to an untimely grave. If you can do any thing for my release, as I trust you can, I beg your interfearence in my behalf.</p>
<p>Yours truly and respectfully
 <lb/><hi rend="underline"><persName ref="cwgk:N00009503">Edward Stevenson</persName></hi></p>
<p>May I hope to hear from you touching this matter?
