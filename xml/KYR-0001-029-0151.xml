<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date>July term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000426">Mason Circuit Court</orgName> 1860</date>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00018760">Thornton Foster</persName> of this <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000446">County</placeName> was fined Sixty dollars for selling whiskey. He was verry poor and not able to pay the fine, and was confined in Jail pursuant to law His wife and two or three of his children of which he has a goodly number were sick some of them at the point of death at the time. His wife had a small house and lot and She appealed to us to unite with her in a bond and set her husband at liberty. We could not refuse, We were satisfied that the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Governor</persName> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State</orgName> would and ought to remit the fine. He was petitioned and postponed its collection one year. The <persName ref="cwgk:N00009200">sheriff</persName> is now about to enforce the payment of the money. <persName ref="cwgk:N00018761">Elizabeth Foster</persName> the wife is good for it, but it will take her home which is her all to pay it. We are both on the bond with her as the Securities of her husband Thornton Foster, but we will lose nothing &amp; only petition in her behalf believing it to be our duty as an act of humanity -- We therefore ask your Excellency to remit so much of the fine as you can</p>
<p>Respectfully
