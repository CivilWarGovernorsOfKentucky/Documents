<p>I certify that I have known Mr <persName ref="cwgk:N00017301">K Kramer</persName> for several years. he has been a tenant of mine for some time. I have always known him to be a hard working man yet occasionally would indulge in intoxicating Liquors. I would suppose that from what I know of him that the act he was committed for, was done while under the influence of Liquor,. his <persName ref="cwgk:N00017312">wife</persName> is afflicted and is almost destitute and depended upon him for support</p>
