<lb/>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">B Magoffin</persName><lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Dear Sir according to your instructions bearing date <date when="1861-05-24">24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inst</date> I lost no time in visiting that portion of the state <hi rend="str">known as the</hi> which lies West of the <geogName ref="cwgk:G00000917">Tennessee River</geogName>, where it was reported a disaffection towards the legally Constituted Authorities ^of the state^ existed, While at <orgName ref="cwgk:O001028">Louisville</orgName> I learned that that a large Military force was being Collected at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003363">Jackson</placeName>,<placeName ref="cwgk:P00000899"> Union city</placeName>, and other points in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tennessee</placeName> <hi rend="str">on</hi>near the line, to await the action of the Convention; and if necessary assist in the unlawful work of disintergrating the state -- </p>
   <p>I deemed this intelligence of so much importance that I <hi rend="str">want</hi> determined to go to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001004">Nashville</placeName> and have an interview with Governor <persName ref="cwgk:N00001929">Harris</persName>, and learn from him if any steps had been taken by the State of Tennesse looking to such a Movement- I arrived in Nashville saturday <date when="1861-05-25">25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst,</date> &amp; accompanied by <persName ref="cwgk:N00000832">W. B. Machin</persName> Esq. Called on the Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> and learned from him that he knew nothing of the cesession<pb/>
    <lb/>Movement, but that he was putting in Camp a large number of troops, for instruction, and for the further purpose of having under arms an effective force, sufficient for any emergency that might arise in Vew of the large Military preparations going on at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004801">Cairo</placeName>, and the threatening attitude assummed by the federal government towards <placeName ref="cwgk:P001003">Memphis, Tenn.</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000893">Columbus</placeName>, Paducah &amp; <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004802">Smithland</placeName> Ky -- </p>
   <p>But he disclaimed altogather any design of invading the soil of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>, for any purpose unless Called on to do so, by the legally constituted authorities, or of interfearing in any way with her right of iminent domain, her politics or policy</p>
   <p>He informed me however, that as there was very great excitement on the border, that I had better Visit it, and see his Confidential agent, ^the Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N00003328">John A Gardner</persName>^ and Show him my instructions (&amp; which I had ^previously^ <unclear>ehibited</unclear> to him) and call his attention to the position assumed by <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName> as innunciated in your proclamation bearing date the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inst, and that he would also, as soon as possible, issue order<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> to the same effect</p>
<p>I arrived at Paducah on sunday <date when="1861-05-26">2<hi rend="str">5</hi>6<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi></date> and Monday<pb/>
<lb/>the <date when="1861-05-27">27<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> took the first train for Tennesse, arriving at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00008486">Fulton Station</placeName> (Tennessee line) at night, and on Tuesday <date when="1861-05-28">28<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> visited the residence of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Gardner but not finding him at home, I addressed him <hi rend="str">the</hi> <hi rend="str">following</hi> <hi rend="str">enclosed</hi> a note, a copy of which you will find enclosed herewith,</p>
<p>Returning to the station, the same night, to await the morning train, while asleep, a gentleman called Me up, and informed Me, that something unusual was going on;- that one hundred men where to go to columbus the following day, &amp; thro up earth works, and that two large forts, two <unclear>found</unclear> Cannon, were being sent up from Memphis to be Mounted there, and the place put in a state of defence, He did not know who was to command the enterprise, or by what authority <hi rend="str">it</hi> a gentleman who was Sleeping in the same room, &amp; who had came up from Memphis the day before Confirmed the account, So far as it related to the Cannon which he said he had passed on the way, &amp; he had learned that they were destined for Columbus</p>
   <p>I lost no time, in getting a Messenger and dispatched <hi rend="str">the</hi> a note to Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00004761">Cheatham</persName> Comman<pb/>
<lb/>-ding forces at Union City, ^a copy of which is enclosed herewith^ and enclosing also a coppy of My Note to M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Gardn, and I have had the pleasure since to learn that my communications arrived in time to stop the further progress of the matter at least for the present -- </p>
   <p>I determined to devote the remaining time before the assembling of the Convention, to <hi rend="str">the</hi> hunting up the delegates in the Counties of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000905">Hickman</placeName> Fulton <placeName ref="cwgk:P001035">Ballard</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000908">Graves</placeName>, and if possibile to show them the damges, and impolicy of the contemplated Movement for the disruption of the state;- all of whom after hearing the arguments against it abandoned it &amp; many were oposed to it before</p>
<p>The convention assembled on the <date when="1861-05-30">30<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> (yesterday) and I am happy to say, that with a few exceptions which might be expected in So large an assemblage Numbering from 3 to 5.000 Men, I never saw better order, or greater loyalty</p>
   <p>The convention Nominated with great unanimity a candidate for Congress, Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N00000749">H C Burnett</persName>, &amp; endorsed your Excellencis proclaimation, &amp; line of policy</p>
<p>I have heard today that 3 or 4.00 Men, without any Military organization are en rout for Columbus, and will arrive today, and that<pb/>
<lb/>they will as soon as they get into Kentucky organise themselves into Companies, as Ky troops and commence the fortification of Columbus I do not know that I have authority to interfear <hi rend="str">but if I have</hi> and shall not attempt it as at present advised, and shall await any further order<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> your Excellency may choose to give me</p>
<p>I have the honor to be yr obt servt.
