   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>The <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor</persName> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName>,</p>
<p>The undersigned, your petitioners, respectfully represent that at the <date when="1861-05">May term 1861</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000641">Hickman Equity &amp; Criminal Court</orgName> the bond of <persName ref="cwgk:N00013285">R. W. Walker</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00002762">J. W. Lockridge</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00013278">W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Lindsay</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00002755">John D. Harlan</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00013277">M. L. Stoner</persName>, for the appearance of <persName ref="cwgk:N00013291">John Sanders</persName> to answer a charge of larceny, was taken for forfeited; and at the <date when="1863-08">August term 1863</date> ^of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000406">Hickman Circuit Court</orgName>^ judgment on said forfeiture was taken against R. W. Walker &amp; M. L. Stoner jointly for the amount of said bond, viz: two hundred and fifty dollars -- the other obligors on the bond not having been served with summons in time for said <date when="1863-08">August term</date>. R. W. Walker &amp; M. L. Stoner will have to pay to the Commonwealth one hundred and seventy five dollars upon said judgment, (they having already paid to <persName ref="cwgk:N00002498">P. D. Yeiser</persName> the Commonwealth's Atty, seventy five dollars, his thirty per centum upon said judgment) unless releived by interposition of executive clemency.</p>
<p>Petitioners will now state that John Sanders was a boy of 14 or 15 years of age whose parents then and now are residents of East <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tennessee</placeName>, but<pb/>
<lb/>having friends and relatives at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00006772">Clinton</placeName><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000905"> Hickman County</placeName><placeName ref="cwgk:P001800"> Ky</placeName> (a portion of whom are on the bond aforesaid) John, the boy, was left at Clinton to go to school. While at school he stole from a play mate an old silver watch and for this offense was by an examining court held to bail in the sum of $250 for his appearance at the Equity &amp; Criminal Court. After giving the bond John remained at Clinton some weeks but being twitted and jeered by his play-mates with theft he ran away and went home, as we presume. The boy's mother, <persName ref="cwgk:N00013287">M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Sanders</persName>, informed her friends at Clinton before the theft occurred that John from early childhood had been afflicted with a monomania for stealing -- that he always readily gave up whatever he might take when called upon to do so and always seemed unable to comprehend the serious nature of his offenses. He was a liberal hearted and affectionate boy, with no unusual defect of character or disposition save his innate and unconquerable propensity to steal.</p>
<p>Before the <date when="1861-05">May term 1861</date> of the Hickman Equity &amp; Criminal Court, at which Sanders was to appear, the Great Rebellion which has afflicted our<pb/>
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P001802">Country</placeName> with so many evils broke out and up to the <date when="1863-08">August 1863</date> the obligors upon said bond have had no opportunity or chance to go to East Tennessee to compel the attendance of John Sanders. His parents, highly repectable people and good citizens have, as petitioners are informed, been broken up &amp; ruined, by the rebellion which has raged around their home in East Tennessee and will be ill able to reimburse those who have befriended their son to the amount of $250. Upon these facts &amp; representations your petitioners resprectfully pray your Excellency to remit the one hundred and seventy five dollars due to the Commonwealth upon said judgment of the Hickman Circuit Court.</p>
