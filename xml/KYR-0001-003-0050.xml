<lb/>Dear sir,</p>
<p>There is a subject, which has been upon my mind, for some time, and I had intended to address you, before this in regard to it.</p>
<p>It is: this; The subject of recruiting Negro soldiers for <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">U S service</orgName>, in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>. Now, my Dear sir; I would urge upon you the importance of resistance to this measure in every legal way, the recruiting of Negroes, the property of our Citizens in the Military service, and more particularly by Agents sent from other states for that purpose- if they are to be recruited at all, it should<pb/>
<lb/>be in behalf of &amp; for the state of Kentucky and be credited to the quota of troops called for -- </p>
<p>It is rumored here that Agents have been sent from other states for that purpose. This thing of plundering our people ought &amp; should be stopped if possible, even recruiting for our own quota would be injurious &amp; demoralizing to our Slave population by the consent and approval of the owner himself I think a firm stand taken by you against it, would have a good effect and even prevent the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">U. S. government</orgName>, from attempting it in our State.</p>
<p>The North is disposed to encroach upon our Constitutional rights and &amp; interest in every possible way she can. &amp; if we truely submit there is no telling when <unclear>this</unclear> encroachment will stop. I believe a firm &amp; decided resistance in all legal ways will have a beneficial effect here.</p>
<p>Yr most Obt. Srv<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>
