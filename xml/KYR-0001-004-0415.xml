   <p><placeName ref="cwgk:P00002273">Princeton</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName>
<lb/><date when="1864-01-26">Jan 26. 1864</date>
<lb/>Gov. <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos. E. Bramlette</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Inclosed you will find the petition of <persName ref="cwgk:N00015686">Mrs Edna Baker</persName> and her son with the records referred to, and the affidavit of <persName ref="cwgk:N00015687">R. L. Wilson</persName> Esq and the certified of <persName ref="cwgk:N00002475">J. N. Turner</persName> the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000605">county court </orgName>Judge of the county court of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002472">Caldwell county</placeName>. Its seems that Judge Turner acted in perfect good faith towards the petitioners, but that the Military did not. There is no evidence that any one acting in a civil capacity here took any part in the unworthy scheme to get Mrs Baker &amp; her son<persName ref="cwgk:N00015680"> Leander</persName> on the Bail Bonds. The evidence however shows that the bonds were procurred by the Military giving assurances which were intended to be violated and were <unclear>regiven</unclear> in order that Bonds might be profuted and then the party <persName ref="cwgk:N00015685">Linn B. Baker</persName> was immediately sent off.</p>
<p>I have not been in the habit of petitioning for the remission of fines and forfietores in the course of a limited practice of 36 years, but I do think this is a case that demands the interposition of the executive to prevent a most grevious fraud and oppression.</p>
<p>Permit me to say that in <date when="1827-11">Nov 1827</date> I settled in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000549">Trigg</placeName> to practice Law where I remained over 36 years. One of my first acquaintances was <persName ref="cwgk:N00015684">Blake Baker</persName> the husband of Edna Baker and the father of the other parties. Blake Baker<pb/>
<lb/>lived long a most respectable, useful influential and honorable citizen of the county.</p>
<p>I have often partaken of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baker's hospitalities and have long personally known Mrs Baker. Her character is that of a most worthy woman. I have nothing against either her or her son Leander during our troubles Given the Rebellion. The payment of the <hi rend="str">fine</hi> forfietures would nearly ruin her and her son. I do not think the proud old State of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName> wishes to get money of old widows by such trickery; and I feel certain our high minded and efficient atty for this District would disdain the 30 per cent even if Judgment were rendered should he know all the facts. As it is he has no right to the 30 per cent until Judgment is rendered.</p>
<p>I have no doubt of the truth of the facts sworn to by Mr Wilson and hope that you will interpose in this case as one especially requiring it.</p>
<p>With high regard I am
<lb/>Respectfully
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00008629">C. D. Bradley</persName></p>
<p>The Union men here coincide fully in all your public views and will stand by you in all your positions.</p>
<p>C. D. Bradley<pb/></p>
