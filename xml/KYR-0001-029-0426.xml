   <p>Somerset <date when="1863-06-20">June 20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1863</date>.</p>
<p>To His Excellency. James. F. Robinson. Governor of Kentucky- The undersigned George. A. Bowyer a citizen of Lexington Ky, would respectfully represent, that a judgment was rendered against him before the Presiding Judge of <hi rend="str">the</hi> Pulaski County ^on <date when="1863-06-20">20 June 1863</date> on charge of pedling without license^ for &#36;100. and cost; He states, that he had been engaged for some time ^past^ in furnishing Military goods to the Division of the Army stationed at Somerset Ky, and not thinking that it was necessary to take out license for that purpose, as I was a bone fide resident and merchant tailor of Lexington Ky. come down to this town for the above stated purpose -- Understanding ^Shortly after I reached this place^ there might possibly be some difficulty in this matter I went <hi rend="str">th</hi>eto the Presiding Judge, and made a full and fair statement of the whole case to him, and promised, if he should so advise to send to Lexington for license, which I did very soon after having this conversation with him, but the application was refused because I was not persenally in court, in the meantime the warrant was sued out against me, and a judgment rendered as above stated -- It is my intention to take out license if I continue to furnish goods to the army, and would ask the interposition of Executive Clemency to save me of this, as I think, unjust fine and punishment -- etc. I did do wrong, it was not with the intent to evade the law, but thro my ignorance of the legal technicalities necessary to be observed in the matter -- <pb/>
<lb/>And I will state to your Honor. that no warrant would have been issued against me, had not some evil disposed person circulated to my injury, that I intend to leave the country on short notice to avoid the prosecution, -- which statement was entirely false -- As a proof of its falsity, the notice of the refusal of the Fayette Clerk to issue me a license never reached here until the warrant was issued -- &amp; I herewith enclose the letter I rec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> from my agent in Lexington conveying to me that information.</p>
