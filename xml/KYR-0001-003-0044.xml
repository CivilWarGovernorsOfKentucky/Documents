<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>I have a <hi rend="underline">personal</hi> favor to ask of you -- which I trust will meet your approval. Should you grant it -- I can only pledge my honest efforts as a loyal man -- and as a brother -- that your assistance shall not be abused if in my power to protect it.</p>
<p>To do so I think and trust will be in my power and hence I pledge my efforts to you personally -- with a Considerable degree of Confidence.</p>
   <p>Suffice it to say -- that I have Just returned from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001134">Washington Cty</placeName> -- where I visited -- for the sole purpose of relieving a youthful <persName ref="cwgk:N00018467">half brother</persName>half brother -- <note place="right margin">X</note>
<lb/>from the Military prison at <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018448">Camp Douglas</orgName>.</p>
<p>He went into the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Confederate</orgName> Service when about 17 years of age -- is yet a minor -- and Since his capture -- some six months ago -- he has made written application to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00005118">Dptment</orgName> -- for the privlege of taking the oath and giving bond for his good behavior &amp;c and for his release from prison.</p>
<p>That petition lies there for months &amp; no action. Respectable -- loyal men of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002992">Woodford</placeName> -- where he was born -- unite in a petition requesting his release -- first upon the ground of his youth and Secondly on<pb/>
<lb/>the ground of the loyalty of his nearest relatives.</p>
<p>So matters have stood for month<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and now stand -- having never yet been brought before the <persName ref="cwgk:N00002647">Sec of War</persName>. I went there for that purpose however and had the papers refered by <persName ref="cwgk:N00018714">Col Hoffman</persName> to Maj Gen <persName ref="cwgk:N00006585">E A Hitchcock</persName> -- Commer of Exchange -- who examined my personal recommendations &amp;c and kindly advised me to have your recommendation for my brothers release forwarded to him and he would specially refer the petition to the Sec of War -- with the recommendation that he be discharged upon <hi rend="underline">Taking</hi> the <hi rend="underline">oath</hi> to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">U S Government</orgName>.</p>
<p>I therefore make this application for your letter of assistance as advised by the General And when in my power I will manifest an equal friendship.</p>
<p>My intention is to send him off to school -- upon his release -- when I trust he will be taught the blessings of a free &amp; United Government.</p>
<p>You will please address me at Louisville
<lb/>Yours Truly
