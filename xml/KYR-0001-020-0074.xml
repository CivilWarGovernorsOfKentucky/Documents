My Father commanded him to stop, Cartwright still advancing in the direction of my Father. my Father commanding him to stop three times -- Cartwright Still approaching came up and took his seat on the boddy of a tree that my Father had cut down at the time Cartwright took his seat my Father was standing on the opposite side of the same two or three steps from Cartwright, Cartwright asked Father if he was going to cut up that tree, and Father told Cartwright that he was, Cartwright then told Father that he would kill him before he should cut said tree up, Father then directed me to cut a log off the tree, and Father marked the place on the tree where he wanted it cut when he had marked it Cartwright got up from where he was sitting on the tree, and came and sit an<hi rend="str">d</hi> the place that <hi rend="underline">father</hi> marked for me to cut the tree -- I started to the place where I was directed by Father to cut the tree, and was about to get upon the tree to cut it, when Cartwright rose from the tree and drew his pistol and stepped<pb/>
<lb/>towards Father, and Father retreated back and as Father retreated Cartwright fired his pistol at Father, and Father fired on Cartwright with his shot gun -- at this time the parties were about eight paces apart Father then drew his Revolver and advanced on Cartwright and fired at him as he advanced, one time, and when he got near enough he took hold of Cartwright and commenced beating him over the head with his pistol -- At this time J Prince came up and Jumped on the back of Father and took him by the shoulders and attempted to pull Father from Cartwright as I thought, Then I ran in and took hold of Prince and pulled him off of Father, When I pulled Prince loose from Father he ran off a peace then returned towards me, and at that time the Slave <persName ref="cwgk:N00014189">Jorden</persName> offered me an axe to defend myself with, but I did not take it, Prince when he saw the slave offer to hand me the axe ran off down towards <persName ref="cwgk:N00014128">Eli nichols</persName> and did not return again.
