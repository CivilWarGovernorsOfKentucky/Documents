Get him to act on it at once and enclose to me. I could have got <persName ref="cwgk:N00002380">Thomas the atty for the Coml<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></persName> to have Joined in the prayer for remital, but it is a goodeal of trouble to write to him &amp; get an answer, &amp; this requires immediate attention -- </p>

But I somehow cant put much faith in the report, yet it May be true, as there was a force awaiting his return -- The Govs message has been received and as far as I here, it is regarded as an able document I have heard no objections to it but much commendation<pb/></p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00012820">Tom Allen</persName> is lying very ill. I learn that he cannot recover-- <persName ref="cwgk:N00000864">The capt.</persName> has very much improved, he is at his office to day. you have all the news that we have in regard to the movement of the army. Therefore I will close. by saying do all you can to put down the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Rebels</orgName>, and give strength to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Union</orgName> -- you friends are all will write me frequently &amp; I will answer promptly my Respects to Dr Bell &amp; accept for yourself sentiments of the highest regard &amp;c.</p>
