   <p>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas E Bramlette</persName><lb/>Governor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky.</orgName></p>
   <p>The petition of the undersigned securities of <persName ref="cwgk:N00006599">Thomas E Reed</persName>, late Sheriff of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000889">Fulton County</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName><lb/>Respectfully Represents 
    <lb/>That a certain action, in the name of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, was brought in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000380">Fulton Circuit Court</orgName>, on the official bond of Thomas E Reed late Sheriff of Fulton County for having taken insufficient security in the case of the Commonwealth agt <persName ref="cwgk:N00006598">Lloyd Brown</persName>, charged with petit larceny. The bail taken by the Sheriff was a married woman. The said Lloyd Brown, it afterwards appeared was removed by his father from the Commonwealth, he. the said Lloyd Brown, being a very small boy. At the next term after his commitment &amp; the execution of the bond with security as aforesaid. his bond with such security as aforesaid, was forfeited, and afterwards, upon the hearing of the same, the bail was discharged, on account of her being a married woman.</p>
<p>Several Terms of the Court thereafter, and as soon as could be done. by said Lloyd Brown, he returned to Fulton County, voluntarily, and gave bail for his appearance at the <date when="1863-09">September Term 1863</date> of the Fulton Circuit Court- when and where, the charge coming on for trial, he was discharged. It<pb/>
<lb/>will thus be seen, that no wrong was done to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Now your petitioners respectfully further represent. That in the action brought in the name of the Commonwealth against Thomas E Reed late Sheriff, the process was served on them &amp; them alone and returned "not found", as to said Thomas E Reed, late Shff as aforesaid, who had left this Commonwealth. As such securities. they have had to pay other and great sums of money, so that their case is a peculiarly hard one. They therefore humbly pray Your Excellency to remit to them the judgt obtained against them in the case aforesaid, at the <date when="1863-09">September Term 1863</date> of the Fulton Circuit Court. And as in duty bound they will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
