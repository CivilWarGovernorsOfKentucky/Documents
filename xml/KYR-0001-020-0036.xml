We hope your Excellency will review the case &amp; give the poor man the benefit of every doubt <hi rend="str">or</hi> ^and we^ desire, that his case may be judged in mercy, &amp; regarded with favor, &amp; that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire that your Excellency may &amp; will be persuaded that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him executive clemency, &amp; that his life may be spared. either by a full pardon or by a commutation of his punishment -- Yours respectfully,
