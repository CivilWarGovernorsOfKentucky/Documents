<lb/>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos E. Bramlett</persName><lb/>Govenor of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName>.<lb/>Dear Sir;</p>
   <p>I received yours of <date when="--09-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Septr last</date>. I immediately <unclear>wrote</unclear> for, and have since obtained copies of the Indictments as well as the judgments upon which executives issued alluded to in yours. It seems one indictment was for attempting to entice away the negro girl <persName ref="cwgk:N00002243">Sarilla</persName>, and the other was for stealing her <unclear>apparl</unclear> jewelry &amp;c, all belonging to the said girl, tho the indictment it was the property of <persName ref="cwgk:N00002244">John Dawson</persName>, which is not true as it was the property of the negro girl. You will find a letter to this effect of <persName ref="cwgk:N00002942">C. J. VanderEspt</persName>, who was living there at the time, and whose testimony would have exonerated <persName ref="cwgk:N00002246">Garis</persName>.</p>
<p>I am in hopes you will send a full remission of the Judgments. The parties are poor and very needy, and if compelled to pay even half of it would bring a perfect ruin upon them.</p>
<p>Yours Very Respy,
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00004236">Jeff Brown.</persName></p>
