   <p>Head Quarters <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009919">Netter's Battalion</orgName><lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P001000">Hartford Ky</placeName> <date when="1862-08-21">Aug. 21/62</date>
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000262">George D. Prentice</persName> Esq.</p>
<p>You have a right to expect me to do something- All my friends have- They have all been kind to me- I would not have it for the world- that they ever came to believe me unworthy of their kindness-</p>
<p>I, came to this place- without a man or a gun- At my arrival here the home guards- were all out- on a wild goose chase after guerrillas-</p>
<p>All that display was made to carry out <persName ref="cwgk:N00000879">Gen. Boyle</persName>'s order to the Major- Having not over twenty men of his own- when he contrived to get his order to take the field-<persName ref="cwgk:N00009925">Maj. Shanks</persName> intendted his campaign as a recruiting expedition.</p>
<p>For that purpose. he swore to &amp; before all who would listen that he was independent of anyone &amp; that whoever joined him- might rely upon remaining all the time near ^to^ his home- as his business &amp; men's was merely, to settle difficulties- protect the locks &amp; dams on<geogName ref="cwgk:G00003748"> green river</geogName> &amp;. &amp;.</p>
<p>Such things ruin the "élans" of the Vol. Service -- Once deceived- the volunteers' enthusiasm is gone forever -- All that imposes upon simple minded young men- </p>
<p>The home guards are tired even yet- of their useless trip- Were no account to take a trip with. when coming back from their excursion -- Found myself paralised- Could not do anything- </p>
<p>If Gen. Boyle- had not been imposed upon so thickly- he would have understood long ago- the deception Practiced upon him. in the matter.</p>
   <p>Maj. Shanks raised most of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009918">17<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky</orgName>- one<pb/>
<lb/>year ago- After serving with it as a Suttler, Q. M. commissary &amp; Major-for three months-the rgimental election came on- His men threw <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>him out of his position of Major -- He went home then -- has been ^at^ home ever since -- </p>
<p>He has now about "one hundred men in all belonging truly to his reg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>" -- I state facts- so help me God -- </p>
<p>His regiment was accepted on the <date when="1862-08-16">16<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> inst</date> -- accepted as Cavalry -- accepted as nearly full --  --  -- </p>
<p>Me, I cannot get any satisfaction -- </p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00000228">Generals Finnell </persName>&amp; Boyle -- ordered me both to raise cavalry- the last named Gen. giving me positive orders stating that fact -- &amp; signing requisitions to that effect -- </p>
<p>Gen. Finnell tells me, in his writen instructions- that my men shall be mounted as soon as permission can be obtained from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00005118">war department</orgName>- That was on <date when="1862-07-25">July the 25<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date> -- promising me also- that if permission was obtained for ^the raising of.^ twelve months troops- the privilege- should be extented to me- as well as to Shakelford &amp; others -- </p>
<p>Gen. Boyle told my Q. M. a few days ago- that I could not be received as such- that the order from the war dep<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>, was imperative &amp; universal- for the non acceptance of twelve months volunteers</p>
<p>As soon as I received the letter- stating, such to be the case -- I told my men. that they were free again- from any obligation to me or U.S. -- I had then three hundred men in camp -- </p>
<p>After liberating them -- I called upon them to remain -- for the sake of their State -- cause -- &amp; people -- for their honor's sake -- Two hundred of them remained by my side -- </p>
<p>It was on the <date when="1862-08-14">14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> inst.</date></p>
   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00000226">H. D. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Henry</persName>- (who will never forgive me -- to have done with 20 men, that which his brother the Col. refused to do with 150 -- )<pb/>
<lb/>has been at work in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>- ever since his arrival &amp; there -- doing all the mischief to my interest that he possibly can -- I have been changed from the 1, to the 3, years service -- Mr. Mc,Hy. wrote home, to his wife a letter which promenaded the streets here- with much show- that I would be ordered away from here &amp; that such an order was made out before he M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Hy. reached <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> &amp; --  --  --  -- </p>
<p>I have not received any such order yet --  --  --  --  --  -- </p>
<p>Shanks is prominating and the letter of McHenry's to-day -- stating that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> will be changed from cavalry to infantry -- or cannot be accepted --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- </p>
<p>My men have been changed once -- They must not be changed again -- Wishing me to do such a thing- would be wanting to drive me out of the service -- The men I recruited are for cavalry -- 100 of them armed (partly only <unclear/> happily) &amp; clothed as cavalrymen -- Wishing to impose upon me &amp; men in any such way would be horrible -- Cannot be -- Would be wrong unfair &amp; unjust -- </p>
<p>Shanks, who does not know how to drill a squad -- with half of field officers in the same fix- waiting to enter the army untill --  --  --  --  --  -- (I won-t say it- but may God forgive me- think it nevertheless) had his rgt accepted- -- on the <date when="1862-08-16">16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst</date>- as cavalry -- his strength then was 73 men -- </p>
<p>I will not speak of myself -- but <hi rend="underline">all that</hi> would be much more aggravating yet -- if it was not so very contemptible</p>
<p>All I ask now to go to work is -- Arms. Horses -- clothing.</p>
<p>My desires &amp; wishes are to remain in the service -- My prayer to the great <hi rend="str">U</hi>unknown "to let me die- if die I must on the battle field" -- with my face turned towards my country's foes my last breath expending itself, in a devout kiss -- to <hi rend="str">my</hi> the <hi rend="str">fine</hi> blade<pb/>
<lb/>drawn in defence of our noble &amp; holy cause!</p>
<p>My men must remain "Cavalry" -- George D. Prentice -- for goodness sake -- for the sake of the service -- do no not foresake me -- My heart wishes me to stay -- "quand même" but mistreatment is a terrible blow, to any one -- Mr Prentice do not allow them to mistreat me -- </p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">The Governor</persName> I understand is a just man -- Will you not tell him- that I am worthy of his protection -- Tell him what may be expected from me -- All I ask is justice -- </p>
<p>Mr Prentice -- believe me please -- as I am</p>
<p>Truly, Your friend &amp; serv<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00009924">Gabriel Netter</persName>.<lb/>Lt. Col.</p>
<p>Gov. Robinson, My Dear Sir, I have thought it best to send Col Netter's letter to you. He is unquestionably a most devoted and enthusiastic <hi rend="str">and devoted</hi> patriot, and one of the most chivalric officers in the service.</p>
<p>Very Truly Yours,
