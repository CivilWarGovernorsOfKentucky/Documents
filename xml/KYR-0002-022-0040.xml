<lb/>Friend <persName ref="cwgk:N00009161">Tom</persName></p>
<p>I write you to suggest to you the propriety and even necesssity of calling the attention of <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Gov Bramlette</persName> to the recent decision of <persName ref="cwgk:N00003045">Genl Fry</persName>. Pro Marr Gen'l U S requiring the Deficit for Draft Men who have Left the country or failed to Report to be made up out of The Names in The original <hi rend="str">Draft</hi> enrollment out of which the Draft was made.</p>
<p>Our citizens who have had a chance to be drafted regard this a violation of law and a <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>great injustice to them. The U S Law holds all Drafted men as in Service from the time of draft<hi rend="str">ed</hi> and publishes them as Deserters:</p>
<p>I wish you also to call attention of The Governor to recent order of<pb/>
<lb/>Gen Fry allowing to 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Cong Dist Ky credits for negroes who have be<hi rend="str">a</hi>en run off to other states and also credits for men cons<hi rend="str">r</hi>crip<hi rend="str">l</hi>t<hi rend="str">d</hi>ed by the Rebels.. and request the Gen to procure an extension of the Same order to the whole state.</p>
<p>It is a matter of great Doubt with me whether the U S army has gained by the Draft in our County So many have gone off probably to Southern army- A farther Draft might have the effect to fill the woods with guerillas.</p>
<p>Enquire How we can obtain credits for our county for those who have enlisted in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001818">Indiana</placeName> Regiments If it is necessary for me to come up to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> in regard to these matters you can Telegraph me at my Expense. Tuesday Eving I will go to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> &amp; will be U S Hotel <hi rend="str">i</hi>on next Wednesday &amp; thursday<pb/>
<lb/>Please asc<hi rend="str">r</hi>ertain whether our Dist Pro Mar has returned to Adj Gen office the no of negro recruits for <date when="1864-08">Aug</date>; <date when="1864-09">Sept,</date> &amp; <date when="1864-10">Oct</date>- also whether any have been reported from offices of Recruiting in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName>,</p>
<p>Please answer as soon as possible &amp; oblige Yours Truly</p>
