Gov all I want is a little more time to fill my battalion we have almost enough men <hi rend="str">to</hi> enlisted to fill our battalion we have been at work but a short time and you must communicate with Gen ^<persName ref="cwgk:N00000879">Boyle</persName>^ to have him give us time enough to gether up our boys I have one company in camp that could be mustered in any hour I have near 200 men present in camps. a word or two in relation to the promise which you made me in reguard to being detached from the Regt for the special protection of the border<pb/></p>
<p>I have raised my men with an understanding that we should protect the border you must communitcate with Gen Boyle to have him send us in that country as soon as we can be Equiped excuse my <hi rend="str">bed</hi> bad writing.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
