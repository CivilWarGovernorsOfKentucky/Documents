<p>Now that said Combs being a poor man, and <hi rend="str">execution issued against him, &amp;</hi> ^and was required to replevey the same in court^ he was about to be imprisoned for the same being unable to pay it said Hampton together with Clinton Combs ^his brother^ repleveyed said fine; which replevey is now near out; and owing to the distracted condition of the country said Akillus or his brother are unable to pay said fine without greatly distressing each of them</p>
<p>Now your petitions would prey that believing as they do that no offence was intended by said Combs &amp; that no inJury was done to the owner of said slave; but that had he been consulted full concent would have been given by him to Combs to treat his boy; &amp; that no citizen was disturbed, that your remit said fine, that said Combs &amp; his security be forever released from the same believing as we do that it would be an act of lenity upon the part of our executive, and that it would meet the approbations of Good citizen Generally<pb/></p>
