<lb/>His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">J F. Robinson</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Some time Since <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Thomas B. Wadlington</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002472">this County</placeName> was convicted of the crime of Murder and was sent to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">penitentiary</orgName> of our state for life.</p>
<p>Since his conviction certain facts have been developed touching the character of the two witnesses on whose evidence the conviction was had. Some twelve months since a large number of affidavits were forwarded to <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Gov. Magoffin</persName> by the neighbors of Wadlington, and the two witnesses, presenting such facts as I think ought to Justify Your Excellency in granting him a free pardon.</p>
<p>I learned after Gov M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Goffin had examined the affidavits refered to that he had expressed a determination to pardon him, and did pardon his son <persName ref="cwgk:N00011765">William </persName>who is now at home.</p>
<p>The affidavits are on file in the secretaries office, and I would respectfully ask Your attention to them at your earliest convenience.
<lb/> 
<lb/>I make this request from a conviction in my own mind that it would be only an act of simple Justice to pardon him. The Lord save our beloved country.</p>
<p>I have the Honour to be very Respty
