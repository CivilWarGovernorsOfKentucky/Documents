   <p>To His Excellincy 
<lb/>B Magoffin
<lb/>Dear sir</p>
<p>Mr A H Talbott was fined at the last June term, of the Henderson Circuit fifty dollars, for selling whiskey to a slave. The proof in the case was in substance as follows Mr Talbott is a dealer in groceries of all discriptions, There was considerable excitement in the county at the time from apprehension of negro insurrection, in consequence of which there was a strong night police, a little after day light two negro<hi rend="sup">s</hi> were discovered standing not far from Mr Talbotts front door by the deputy marshall. Mr Talbotts house is on a corner, and the negroes broke as soon as they saw the deputy Marshall, one of them passing through<hi rend="str">t</hi> Talbotts house and leaving at the back door, The Marshall pursued caught the negro &amp; found upon ^one^ a bottle of whisky, There <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>are ^on^ the square with Talbott several other grocery establishments all dealing in whisky --.</p>
<p>Mr Talbott is a highly respected<pb/>
<lb/>citizen and as far from violations of law as any in our community</p>
<p>For his standing and character we refer you to Grant Green &amp; Judge Young -- I do not believe he was guilty, but upon the proof he was so found, but as I believe because of an universal feeling in this community against the offense, It is but due to candour that I should say to you I was of counsel for Mr T. but I am ^not^ influenced in the least by that fact in thus writing to you</p>
<p>I honestly believe he was innocent &amp; therefore ask a remmission</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>Jno W Crockett</p>
<p>I ask your Excellency to regard &amp; treat the above letter as my petition to have the fine referred to remitted, assuring your Excellency of my innocence</p>
<p>A, H, Talbott<pb/></p>
