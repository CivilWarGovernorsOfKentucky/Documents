<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Hon James F Robinson</persName><lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
   <p>I Recd a day or two since from the last surviving brother of my departed father; -- bending under the weight of years, a request that I exert what influence I possessed to release him from Confinement at <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009501">Camp <hi rend="str">c</hi>Chase.</orgName></p>
<p>I Refer to <persName ref="cwgk:N00009503">Revd Edward Stevenson</persName> D D principle of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002479">Russelville</placeName> Ky, ^female institute^ who informed me he had furnished you with a brief statement of the Causes of his imprisonment, which I entertain no doubt truly sets fourth the facts as understood by him.</p>
<p>I Regret exceedingly that under any circumstances he should have suffered himself to have been placed on a vigilence Committee, and especially that he acted as Chairman, thus making himself prominent, (or apparently so) in persecuting union men for union sentiments.</p>
<p>His explanation is, that he was solicited by union men to accept the position, with the view of Restraining and moderating the action of violent and ultra men, in which he thinks he succeeded.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, I would fain hope that two months Confinement in prison would exert such a soothing influence upon<pb/>
<lb/>his future course as will prove salutary to both himself, and others.</p>
<p>He informs me he is willing to take the oath of allegiance to the General and state government, and execute Bond in any Reasonable sum that may be required of him.</p>
<p>Did I doubt for one moment his faithfully adhering to such Reasonable requisitions, much as I sympathize with him and his bereaved, and afflicted family, I would not touch pen to paper for his Release.</p>
<p>I have written the president of the united states a brief statement of facts connected with his case, asking his Release upon the Conditions above suggested.</p>
<p>If consistently with your views of propriety, you can afford me any assistance in the accomplishment of this object, you will contribute to the relief of a distressed family, who very greatly need his assistance at home, especially so at this time, as his shool Resumes its Session in ^a^ week or two</p>
<p>your known devotion to the union, connected with your executive position with our Loyal state government, renders your assistance in this emergency most desirable.</p>
   <p>I leave a space, trusting that you will feel <hi rend="str">h</hi>no hesitancy in Recomending to the <persName ref="cwgk:N001760">presi<pb/>
    <lb/>dent</persName> the exercise of executive clemency in this case, which I will be happy to accept as a personal kindness to myself.</p>
<p>With sentiments of high esteem I Remain yours most Respectfully</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00009502">Milton Stevenson</persName></p>
<p>If the facts as above stated in relation to the Rev Ed<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stevenson are correct and I have had them verified from other Sources, I do not ^hesitate^ to concur in the desire expressed for his release upon his complying the requisitions of the Department -- <persName ref="cwgk:N00009504">Senator Rhea</persName> is acquainted with the facts and it would be well to refer to him</p>
