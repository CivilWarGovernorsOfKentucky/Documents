   <p>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">B. Magoffin</persName> Gov. of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>Your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00018849">Henry Hudson</persName> respectfully represents, that some few months ^since^ he became bound in a recognizance, as surety for one <persName ref="cwgk:N00018840">John H Miller</persName>, in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName>, for the sum of Five Hundred dollars. Miller was indicted in said Court for stealing about fifteen dollars from Frederick Volk <unclear/> ins <note place="left margin">Volkins</note> and Miller not appearing at <date when="1861-11">the ^last^ November</date> term of said Court, the recognizance was forfeited, and about ten days ago, Judgment was obtained against this petitioner and execution issued</p>
<p>Miller had been employed as a clerk in the store of this petitioner, about a year before the imputed offence, and had conducted himself honorably, and faithfully; and on that account and from sympathy, for him, this petitioner was induced to become bound for him in the recognizance.</p>
<p>Petitioner also believed that he was innocent of the charge.</p>
<p><hi rend="str">Volkins</hi> ^Miller^ got into a frolic with the man who is said to have lost<pb/>
<lb/>the money. When asked for it Miller readily admitted he had it, and surrendered it. When Miller was bailed, he applied to this petitioner to permit him to go and seek work, none could be obtained by him in the City of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName>. And this petitioner as <unclear/>, and Miller went into the Southern part of this state, and petitioner believes he would have returned, and stood his trial but he was unable to get to Louisville. Petitioner believes he will yet return, and stand his trial.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he has not received any remuneration, or indemnity, on account of his liability as Bail for Miller, and in these hard times of ^payment of^ the five Hundred dollars <unclear>as</unclear> exacted <hi rend="str">of</hi> <hi rend="str">petitioner</hi> it will be impossible to raise ^the^ money and petitioner will be either compelled to go to Prison, or have his property (which is but little) entirely sacrificed. In this view of the matter your petitioner respectfully asks that you will respite the execution a reasonable time<pb/>
<lb/>in order that he may produce Miller; and if that cannot be done to raise the Money and pay off the execution. <hi rend="str">for the five Hundred dollars.</hi> The execution is now in the hands of the Sheriff</p>
<p>Your petitioner earnestly hopes that time will be allowed him. If it should be refused, the loss to him, will be most oppressive. Your petitioner has long been a resident of Louisville, and he trusts and believes that no one would be willing to impute to it the commission of any wrong</p>
