   <p>His Excellency Governor Robinson</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Welcome Mullins States that at the <date when="1861-03">March Term 1861</date> of the Laurel Circuit Court he was fined &#36;50. upon an Indictment for carrying concealed weapons and also &#36;15. upon an Indictment for disturbing religions worship -- and upon the last mentioned fine he obtained a <hi rend="underline">respite</hi> which expired on the <gap/> day of <date when="1863">1863</date>. and the sheriff of Laurel County now has execution against petitioner and is endeavoring to make the money for both fines and costs off of him and his Securities -- in regard to the &#36;50. he refers to the petition on file in the office of secretary of state of Wesley Mullins upon which a fine of &#36;50. was respited against Wesley -- and he says that the same facts made in his case and the same reasons are urged for a remittance -- and in addition to the statements made in his petition on which the respite in each case was granted he says, that he is less able to pay the fines now than then, that the Rebel Army under Kirby Smith on their retreat from Ky. took every thing in a manner that he had -- and it is now utterly out of his power to pay said fine and costs -- He repeats all the statements made in his original petition and says they are true -- He says that it will greatly Oppress him to pay as much even as the costs -- He then prays that your Excellency <hi rend="underline">remit</hi> the said fines -- </p>
<p>Welcome Mullins</p>
