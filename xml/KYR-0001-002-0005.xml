   <p>Head-Quarters Military Commander, Louisville.
<lb/>Louisville, <date when="1863-11-17">Ky., Nov 17 1863.</date></p>
<p>Hon. Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Ky
<lb/>Govenor.</p>
<p>To counteract the evil purposes of some bad men who would misrepresent Brig. Gen, Boyle to effect his removal and foust upon Ky as Mil. Commander some pure fanatical partizan. I desire to have Col A. H. Markland general Post office agent <hi rend="underline">appointed An aid on your staff</hi>. As a matter of <unclear> course </unclear> the office is merely honorary and does not draw a salary. You may remember that Gov. Wickliffe claimed at Washington that Markland was not a Kentuckian, and Casey who in his rabbidness would see Kentucky <unclear/> also asserts that Markland is not a Kentuckian and does not represent the sentiment of Ky. This Casey with his Clique and Silas Miller as chief fugler have had General Grants mind abused about General Boyle And Markland Can and will have it all set right if he can be so placed as would give him Kentucky's endorsement. which can be effectually<pb/>
<lb/>done by such recommendation from you as his appointment on your staff. Markland has the confidence of General Grant and can certainly make the truth predominate over the rascalities of men who seek personal advancement and revenge at the sacrifise of our people if properly endorsed by You. Col Markland goes to Chattanooga tomorrow and I hope you will forward to him a Commission as Col. on your staff. I have no selfish motives or personal interest involved in this application</p>
<p>And Am Respectfully
<lb/>M Mundy
<lb/>Col &amp; Mil. Comt,<pb/></p>
<p>A. H. Markland
