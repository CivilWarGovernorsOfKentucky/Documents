<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the last term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000351">Barren Circuit Court</orgName> an Indictment for "Hog stealing" was found and returned by the Grand Jury against <persName ref="cwgk:N00002588">E K. Owsley</persName> Esq -- from my long and intimate acquaintance with M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> O<hi rend="sub">s</hi>- his character standing as a Gentleman of irreproachable integrity -- I need not assure you that I was astounded at such an accusation; I have made enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the case. and am gratified to be able to state from reliable information, that the prosecution is malicious and unfounded -- It might be that the same feeling of malevolence that set on foot the charge might stimulate the parties to sustain it, and M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Owsley has thought proper to ask that the proceeding be stopped before trial and in that view of the case I cheerfully join with him in asking your Excellencys interposition in his behalf, I do this too the more willingly on account of his much esteemed relations and family with whom I have mingled in closest ties of friendship from early boyhood. Hoping that your Excellency will favourably consider this application</p>
<p>I remain
<lb/>very Respt
<lb/>your friend &amp; obt
<lb/>servant
