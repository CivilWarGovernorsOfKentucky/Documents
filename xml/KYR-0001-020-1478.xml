   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName> Governor of the state of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00004337">Charles Mytinger s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi></persName> respectfully states that at the <date when="1861-10">October Term of the Mason Circuit Court 1861</date> -- he was fined sixty dollars for keeping a Tippling-House in the city of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001219">Maysville</placeName>: He has been for many years prior to his removal to Kentucky, a citizen of the state of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001036">Ohio</placeName>, he is poor and in feeble, health and by the kindness and assistance of friends set up in a small grocery the profits of which he fears will be inadequate to his support; to two or more of his friends upon several occasions he sold liquor and which acts he now learns were forbidden by the law = your Excellency has been pleased to remit or stay the collection of a fine imposed upon him by the <persName ref="cwgk:N00008307">Mayor of the City of Maysville</persName> for a similar offence; but the offence for which he was indicted and fined by the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000426">Circuit Court</orgName> was committed before that tried by the Mayor; both were done by him in ignorance of the law -- <pb/>
<lb/> -- so soon as he learned by the admonition (of the trial) and judgment of the Mayor he desisted and so now remains = "Ignorance of the law excuseth no man", so say those who administer it, but it is he hopes a good reason for the exercise of Mercy; his poverty and his ill health both unite in asking your Excellency to remit the said fine and prevent his becoming the feeble and helpless te<hi rend="str">i</hi>nant of a Jail, with the assurance that he will indeed in this matter at least "sin no more"</p>
<p>Charles Mytinger </p>
<p>We citizens of Maysville and <placeName ref="cwgk:P0000446">Mason County</placeName> respectfully unite in the prayer of the foregoing petition.</p>
