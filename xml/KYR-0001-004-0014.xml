   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00003057">Paul Garras</persName>, Started from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003061">new Haven, Ky</placeName>. about the <date when="1860-05-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of May 1860</date>, to take possession of a grist mill leased from <hi rend="str">Jack Dawson</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00003063">W. Carden</persName>, &amp; located on <geogName ref="cwgk:G00009916">rolling fork</geogName>, When he begun at s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> mill he had a capital of $1800; he employed in the Mill <persName ref="cwgk:N00002936">Erhard Duplain</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00002937">Anthony Julian</persName>, the former is a carpenter by trade, and the other (^as a Journeyman),^ was in <date when="1862">1862</date>, employed as a cook for <persName ref="cwgk:N00003910">Col. Grose</persName>, of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003066"><orgName ref="cwgk:O00003066">36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regt Indiana Vol</orgName>.</orgName> (now deceased), Chs Vander Espt was living at the time temporarily with s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Garras, and remained with him, until he left, which was towards the <date when="1861-04-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> or <date when="1861-04-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of April 1861</date>.</p>
   <p>As to the intimacy said to be existing, between Garras and the Colored girl <persName ref="cwgk:N00002938">Cirilla</persName>, a slave of <persName ref="cwgk:N00003058">Jack Dawson</persName> of New Haven af<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi>, it is Known, She was washing for Paul Garras, and his hands, s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Dawson,, Knew it, on the <date when="1860-12-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of Dec. 1860</date> Vander Espt got married, and occupied a room in Garras' House where the afor<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> slave frequently called on <persName ref="cwgk:N00002943">Mrs Vander Espt</persName> to learn the making of her own dresses, about the <date when="--04-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of April</date> Erhard Duplain referred above made a trunk for Vander Espt, to pack in his books, which being too small was voluntarily given to s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00002938">Cirilla</persName> to put her clothes in, Consequently P. Garras did not order the trunk, neither did he Stole the clothes &amp; Jewellery of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Slave, as represented on the Indictment, issued by the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000479">Nelson Circuit Court</orgName>, under date of <date when="1861-05-01">May 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1861</date>. this is a feeble effort on the part of Dawson, and perfectly untrue, in as much as it can be proved that Garras, never intended to run off the Girl afor<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi>, The trunk<pb/>
    <lb/>at the application of the Girl <persName ref="cwgk:N00002938">Cirilla</persName> was sent to <persName ref="cwgk:N00002944">Mrs widow Hay</persName>, Dry goods dealer, of that locality, not far from the dwelling of J, Dawson, this being from fear that her master would not allow her to retain the trunk at home, it was not intended for a mean purpose, as mentioned on the Indictment, P, Garras, furnished flour and lumber to s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> J. Dawson &amp; to his sons amongst whom, was <persName ref="cwgk:N00003059">W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi></persName> who owed Garras a certain amount of money, which was never paid Garras intending to go to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003065">little </placeName><placeName ref="cwgk:P00003065"><placeName ref="cwgk:P00003065">Rock Ark</placeName></placeName>,, This vexed Dawson's family, and without any Just a cause, accused Garras of attempting to run away with S<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Slave. In this case, Mr <persName ref="cwgk:N00002299">Lowell H. Rousseau</persName> was the defensor of the accused, when called into the army, he could not go and attend to this case. Shortly after the arrival of Garras in Louisville, he was arrested by policeman <persName ref="cwgk:N00001229">Kirk Patrick</persName>, and taken back to New Haven, where an infuriated mob would have hanged the accused had it not been for the intervention of some friends, his life would have been in danger. Having spent his hard earnings, and having no work in Louisville, he went to Memphis, and probably is now in its vicinity, occupied as a Mill wright; the difficulty of corresponding then, from Louisville to Memphis, previous to the taking of this latter place, is probably the cause by which his securities were obliged to pay considering the impossiblity of the accused to appear in Court. The character of Garras is good, there as some ways &amp; means on the Indictments, which in<pb/>
<lb/>some respects, seems incomprehensible. Herein went <hi rend="underline">Secy</hi> By pure humanity, It is well to represent that many persons are indebted to s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Garras in New Haven perhaps it was the cause which prompted his debtors, named therein, to accuse him of larceny, as represented on the Indictments whereof.</p>
