   <p>Dear friend I have just now learned by a friend that <persName ref="cwgk:N00012731">Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Wadlington</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00014143">James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goodwin</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002273">Princeton</placeName> have gone to Frankfort with a view of making intercession for the unfortunate <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">T. B. Wadlington</persName> who is under sentence of death for the murder of <persName ref="cwgk:N00011760">Cartwright</persName>. The people of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002615">Hopkins</placeName> as well as those of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002472">Caldwell County</placeName> are strongly impressed with the belief that the Conviction of T. B. Wadlington is unjust and based wholy upon false Testimony, that W killed Cartwright we have no doubt, but that he did it in sef defence &amp; that he was shot first we have not a solitary dout In Consequence of this we have gotten petitioners in this county numbering about six hundred, and will send them tomorrow morning by private hand to Princeton and from there will endeavor to have them sent on by express to his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Gov M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin</persName> We therefore ask you to inform the Governor, M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goodwin, &amp; Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Wadlington of the fact that our Petitions will reach there in a few days and to give them time to arrive before pressing the Governor to a decision in the case</p>
<p>We think we see the right spirit and feeling manifested by our <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000923">Ky Legislature</orgName>, such as will teach both the extreme North &amp; South, that Ky stand as she has ever stood true &amp; Loyal to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Union</orgName>. Hopking you will have good health we subscribe ourselves,</p>
<p>Your friends truly

<lb/>If you can say any thing in favor of our unfortunate Wadlingtons case to Gov M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin, do so. You a least can say truly that you<pb/>
<lb/>are acquainted with many of the petitioners and testify as to their character &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
