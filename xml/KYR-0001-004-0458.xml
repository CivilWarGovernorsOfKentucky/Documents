<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>This will be handed you by <persName ref="cwgk:N00010738">Mrs Banks</persName> who is the <hi rend="str">husban</hi> wife of <persName ref="cwgk:N00005830">William Banks</persName> convicted for felony at the <date when="--01">January term</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName>.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N002040">Robt F. Baird</persName> Esqr. a few days ago, laid before you a petition for a pardon for W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Banks &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00005831">John McClure</persName>, &amp; also a copy of the Indictment <hi rend="str">&amp;</hi> in which a count for stealing &amp; a count for receiving knowing the property to be stolen was alledged On the last count the parties were convicted.</p>
<p>Mr Baird &amp; Myself did not defend the parties; they were defended by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00016363">Joseph Reed</persName> formerly of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001718">Larue county</placeName>, &amp; a brother of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000835">Senator Reeds</persName>, The interest that we take in the case springs from sympathy &amp; nothing else; we heard the trial &amp; from the evidence for &amp; against, we did not think a case for receiving was made out, &amp; the evidence as to the Larceny was clearly in favor of the defendants.</p>
<p>Your Excellency had with the petition a substantial statement of the<pb/>
<lb/>testimony &amp; I indulge the hope that a reconsideration of the case by your Excellency will result in the release of the parties.</p>
<p>I will state a fact that may not be known to your Excellency, namely, that W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Banks was on Bail for several months &amp; without compulsion came forward &amp; stood his trial</p>
<p>Verry Respectfully
