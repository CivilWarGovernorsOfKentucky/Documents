<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Magoffin</p>
<p>I had committed to my care the Petition to Your Excellency, of William Smith of Rockcastle, asking you to remit a fine imposed upon him by the Circuit Court of that County of &#36;50, for a violation of the law prohibiting the sale of spiritous liquors to slaves without written authority from the Master -- I have lost the petition -- </p>
<p>The facts as set forth in the petition are these, Smith is quite a youth, and at the time was keeping his fathers grocery -- as attached to his tavern -- both properly licensed on presentment of the Grand<pb/>
<lb/>Jury -- Smith went before the Court and Confessed judgment </p>
<p>Several members of the jury as well as a number of the best citizens of the vicinity signed the petition asking the Remission also -- the acting Commonwealth's Attorney -- writes a note to your Excellency, saying he thinks it would be right and proper to remit</p>
<p>I know Young William Smith well, as well as all the Gentlemen who signed the petition, They are all amongst the most Respectable citizens of Mountvernon, and the vicinity </p>
<p>Mr Smith himself is a very worthy youth, and as this is the only misdeed with which I have ever known him charged, I should be pleased to see the fine remitted</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
