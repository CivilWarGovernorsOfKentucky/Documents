<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>You may have some anxiety to hear from the convention at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003915">Mayfield</placeName> to which so large a share of publick attention has been directed. There was a very large assemblage a great deal of enthusiasm. and a strong attempt to force <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> resolutions, but <persName ref="cwgk:N00000749">Burnett</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00000832">Machem</persName> &amp; myself succeeded in the end to have resolutions drawn by Myself adopted by an overwhelming vote as a substitute for your information I Give to you the resolutions</p>
<p>Be it resolved by the delegates from the first Congressional district of Kentucky ^a convention^ assembled in the Town of Mayfield <date when="1861-05-30">May 30 1861</date> That the assumption of power by <persName ref="cwgk:N001760">abram Lincon</persName> President of the United States in waging a bloody and cruel war against eleven of our sister slave states, The large increase of the regular <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">army</orgName> and of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00005307">Navy</orgName>. The Blockade of foreign commerce, the interdiction of trade between places and sections of the union, The expenditure of large<pb/>
<lb/>sums of Money. The creation of an enormous publick debt of his own will and act without any previous legislation by Congress as unconstitutionl and the erection of a Naked Military despotism to rule over the rights and liberties of the people.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Resolved, That the occupation of any portion of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName> ^by Black republican troops^ Whilst she Maintains her present position would be regarded as a menace upon the sovereignty of the States and a coersion of the will and action of the citizens and such troops should be impelled by the Govenour using all the forces at his Command, and such other as the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Government of Kentucky</orgName> May be able to procure.</p>
<p>The 3 resolution endorsed Your refusal to furnish troops to Lincon -- </p>
<p>4 -- Resolution condems the importation of federal arms by <persName ref="cwgk:N00000934">Davis </persName>&amp; Co -- </p>
<p>This District is all right- there will be nothing to disturb the publick peace or to act in defiance of the state Government -- <pb/></p>
<p>We are all ready at a Moments warning to fly to arms at your command- the Southern feeling is rapidly on the increase. all you see in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001002">Louisville Journal</orgName> about arms leaving here for <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tennesse</placeName> are false, there was a report and it seemed so well authenticated that the troops from <placeName ref="cwgk:P001036">Ohio</placeName> would Make a dash upon this place &amp; sieze the publick arms that Many of the leading citizens advised Col Tilgman to remove to Mayfield for safety &amp; it was done. If you do not verry soon order the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000303">State Guard </orgName>into Camp for drill or to errect foritifications in a verry short time, that arm of defence here will be dissipated by the flower of our youth leaving to Join the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Confederate army</orgName> -- If order into camp they will take the oath when properly explained there is peace and quite here. No terrorism all feel free and Union Men feell safe &amp; fraternal concord exists</p>
<p>Verry truly
<lb/>Your ob Sert
