   <p>Paducah <date when="1861-06-02">June 2/61</date>
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>You may have some anxiety to hear from the convention at Mayfield to which so large a share of publick attention has been directed. There was a very large assemblage a great deal of enthusiasm. and a strong attempt to force <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> resolutions, but Burnett Machem &amp; myself succeeded in the end to have resolutions drawn by Myself adopted by an overwhelming vote as a substitute for your information I Give to you the resolutions</p>
<p>Be it resolved by the delegates from the first Congressional district of Kentucky ^a convention^ assembled in the Town of Mayfield <date when="1861-05-30">May 30 1861</date> That the assumption of power by abram Lincon President of the United States in waging a bloody and cruel war against eleven of our sister slave states, The large increase of the regular army and of the Navy. The Blockade of foreign commerce, the interdiction of trade between places and sections of the union, The expenditure of large<pb/>
<lb/>sums of Money. The creation of an enormous publick debt of his own will and act without any previous legislation by Congress as unconstitutionl and the erection of a Naked Military despotism to rule over the rights and liberties of the people.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Resolved, That the occupation of any portion of Kentucky ^by Black republican troops^ Whilst she Maintains her present position would be regarded as a menace upon the sovereignty of the States and a coersion of the will and action of the citizens and such troops should be impelled by the Govenour using all the forces at his Command, and such other as the Government of Kentucky May be able to procure.</p>
<p>The 3 resolution endorsed Your refusal to furnish troops to Lincon -- </p>
<p>4 -- Resolution condems the importation of federal arms by Davis &amp; Co -- </p>
<p>This District is all right- there will be nothing to disturb the publick peace or to act in defiance of the state Government -- <pb/></p>
<p>We are all ready at a Moments warning to fly to arms at your command- the Southern feeling is rapidly on the increase. all you see in the Louisville Journal about arms leaving here for Tennesse are false, there was a report and it seemed so well authenticated that the troops from Ohio would Make a dash upon this place &amp; sieze the publick arms that Many of the leading citizens advised Col Tilgman to remove to Mayfield for safety &amp; it was done. If you do not verry soon order the State Guard into Camp for drill or to errect foritifications in a verry short time, that arm of defence here will be dissipated by the flower of our youth leaving to Join the Confederate army -- If order into camp they will take the oath when properly explained there is peace and quite here. No terrorism all feel free and Union Men feell safe &amp; fraternal concord exists</p>
<p>Verry truly
<lb/>Your ob Sert
<lb/>J Campbell</p>
