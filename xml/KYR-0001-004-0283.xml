<p>The excuse given in the petition is not a good one for not making defense and in ordinary times would not justify Remission but in a time of Civil war when every loyal man ought to be armed for defense; I think none should be fined for being armed. I therefore remit the fine except costs &amp; fees <date when="1863-11-24">Nov 24" 1863</date></p>
