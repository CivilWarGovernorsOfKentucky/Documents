   <p>I desire to call your attention to the fact that the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018481">86<hi rend="sup">th</hi>Regt. Ohio</orgName>six months men which has been at <geogName ref="cwgk:G00009417">Cumb. Gap</geogName> for some time past and whose term of service has just expired passed this place today en route for <placeName ref="cwgk:P001036">Ohio</placeName>taking with them eight or ten slaves belonging to good and loyal citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000855">Knox County</placeName> Ky. The owners of some of these slaves followed and with my assistance took possession of their negroes but they were forcibly rescued and taken from them by the soldiers of this Regiment. The people of this section are loyal in the true sense and complain at nothing which is necessary for the suppression of the rebellion but they are greatly excited<pb/>
<lb/>over this unnecessary and wanton robbery Is there no relief for them and no way to prevent their slaves from being forcibly carried beyond the limits of this state?</p>
<p>Respectfully
