<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I received your note to day and ^am^ very willing to state that I have not only examined <persName ref="cwgk:N00003612">Angelo Devoto</persName> but that, I have been frequently called upon to prescribe for him since his confinement in Jail. His health is injured by confinement <unclear/> in Jail, he is suffering from disease of the chest and genenal constitutional neuralgia, to recover from which release from confinement is necessay, and I do not think he would stand confinement in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName>, I also know that he has a family of small children, who are entirely destitute of the necessaries of life, and depend wholy upon charity for subsistance.</p>

<p>P. S. I have known his for some <hi rend="str">D</hi>years and have never heard his character impeached before.</p>
