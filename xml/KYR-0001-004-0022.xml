<lb/><date when="1863-09-14">Septr. 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1863</date>.
<lb/>To
<lb/>Govenor Bramlette,</p>
<p>Your petition Warren Parker who resides in Franklin County on Cedar Creek twelve miles from Frankfort, states that during the canvass of <date when="1861">1861</date>, he was induced to have a burgoo -- at which the offence hereinafter named was charged to have been committed. At the last term of the Franklin Circuit Court he was fined in the sum of sixty dollars for the offence of selling spirits at the burgoo. The only witness against him was Spencer Davidson with whom your petitioner was on ill terms, who stated that he had bought spirits from your petitioner; so far from this being so, he has never sold any ardent spirits of any kind to Davidson.</p>
<p>There being no evidence against your petitioner until the last term of the Court, he supposed the prosecution was abandoned, and was not present, nor had he consulted with his lawyer on the subject.</p>
<p>Your petitioner considers that he is a good citizen and a law abiding man.<pb/>
<lb/>He hopes his <hi rend="str">petition</hi> fine will be remitted. Your petitioner is a man of humble means, which do not amount to over &#36;300 -- all told.</p>
<p>Warren ^his X mark^ Parker</p>
