<lb/>Dear <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Sir</persName></p>
<p>There will be presented to you for your examination and Consideration a copy of the Record from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000363">Caldwell Circuit Court</orgName> in the Case of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName> against <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Thomas Wadlington</persName> Convicted of Murder, and also a petition for his pardon. I was one of his Counsel and feel Confident in my own mind that he was improperly and illegally Convicted. That he was not guilty of murder, in slaying <persName ref="cwgk:N00011760">Cartwright</persName>, and let him have erred every so much, he was not guilty as charged. There was an certain destitution of proof of malice express &amp; the malice implied by the killing was rebutted by the proof and Circumstances in the Case, and I think if there could be a Case Justifying the interposition of the Executive the Case of Wadlington is that Case. I am not in the habit of asking the interposition of the Governor to prevent the carrying out the Judgments of the Courts, but in the Case under Consideration, I should be doing violence to my Convictions of what is Justice if I failed to ask you to Consider and grant the prayer of petitioners for his pardon</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00013992"><hi rend="underline">M. Mayes</hi></persName></p>
