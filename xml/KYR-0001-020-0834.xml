<lb/>My dear sir</p>
<p>At the present term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000362">Christian Circuit</orgName> one <persName ref="cwgk:N00018780">George Long</persName> -- a free man of color -- born and raised in our town was convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to pay a fine and to three months imprisonment in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018781">County Jail</orgName>.</p>
<p>The offense with which he was charged was an assault upon a white <persName ref="cwgk:N00018778">man</persName>.</p>
<p>I am not accurately or minutely informed as to the facts -- that is -- I did not hear the trial. But from the statements of those who were present at the trial and cognizant of the facts I am well persuaded that George<hi rend="sup">s</hi> case <hi rend="str">presents</hi> ^is^ one that is entitled to executive clemency.</p>
<p>I have known him from childhood. He belonged for many years to a highly respectable family of this place and with whom I have always been intimate. George has always been remarkable for his good behavior and especially for his humility and politeness. His former-owners say that he never was insolent or insubordinant and I have no doubt of the truth of their statements. For many years he lived a close neighbor to me and a more polite humble or better behaved boy I never<pb/>
<lb/>knew. And until charged with this offense -- although he has been free for many years -- he has never been suspected of any impropriety even the least.</p>
<p>I believe the community here would be highly gratified that he should be pardoned -- indeed there is a very decided desire that he should. And from my knowledge of George and the information I have of the facts, I do believe his case merits and should recieve the favorable consideration of your excellency</p>
<p>Very Respfly
<lb/>Yr friend
