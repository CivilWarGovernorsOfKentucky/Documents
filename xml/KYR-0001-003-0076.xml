<lb/>Col:</p>
<p>A matter was brought before me to day, which I think surely demands our consideration: especially when it is in this section of country, where <hi rend="underline">treason</hi> has in the past, and even now, showes itself so plain -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Court</hi> is now in <hi rend="underline">session</hi>, and a reble Court, out<hi rend="str">,</hi> and out, Judge and all -- I came very near having some trouble with the court about 2 men belonging to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00008607">48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Vols</orgName>, who were in jail and had been demanded by the military at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002479">Russellville</placeName>, whereupon they pointedly refused to give them up; And in consequence of their stubborn, <hi rend="underline">secesh</hi> nature I had to call out about half the company The men were then acquited, and peace restord, But now, I find that all the Judges who were over the <hi rend="underline">poles</hi> at august election, have<pb/>
 <lb/>been indited by the Grand Jury, by this court simply, for conforming to <persName ref="cwgk:N00011757">Col Johnson</persName>s orders which were the same as <persName ref="cwgk:N00011754">Col Fester</persName>s, and not allowing <hi rend="underline">no</hi> <hi rend="underline">traitor</hi> to cast a vote, or a man who had intentionally, and wilfully aided the so, called <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Confederate States, of America</orgName>, or <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003448"><hi rend="underline">Provisional</hi> Government of Ky</orgName></p>
<p>The Judges only conformed to military and as the state is under <hi rend="underline">Martial</hi> <hi rend="underline">Law</hi>, above civil law I cant see how the Civil Court can indite, the Judges of the Election; And as such was occasioned by the Military. I think that the Military ought to support, the ones who have been wronged by the civil authorities -- I would like to interfere, if I can reasonably do so, in behalf of the Judges of the Election, and consequently consult your better Judgement, and will await your approval or disapproval, of my ideas</p>
