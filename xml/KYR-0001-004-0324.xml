   <p>Franklin Simpson County Ky.
<lb/><date when="1863-12-01">1 December 1863</date>,
<lb/>To Col Cicero Maxwell
<lb/>Bowling Green Ky,</p>
<p>The undersigned citisins of Simpson County, and loyal to their government, and the old flag<hi rend="str">e</hi> of their Country, have heard that Some thought exists of Ordering, Major S F Johnson with the force under his Command at this place to some other part of duty.</p>
<p>We beg leave respectively to protest against it. We do So in behalf of the truly Union Citsins of Simpson County, whose feelings on this question we know we represent.</p>
<p>A few, (very few) persons, who <hi rend="underline">claim</hi>, to be loyal we are aware desire his removal, but the really loyal men of the County. Those who are so from principle, desire that he &amp; his command Should continue here, Why? Because there is as much if not more of rampant treason in this County than any similar amount of territory in the State. Major Johnson Understands the nature, and extent of that treason. and knows how to manage it. He can crush it or keep it within bounds. He has labored hard to recruit the 52 Reg. and a portion of it having Just been mounted<pb/>
<lb/>he is now in a Condition to operate against the guerilla thieves, and Robbers who are infesting the Country.</p>
<p>We are Satisfied that he will very soon share his efficiency in Capturing guerillas and Suppressing raids, He will afford ample protection to the Railroad within the District in which he operates.</p>
<p>We could say much more in remonStrance, but regard it unnecessary. Major Johnson is emphatically the man for this post. And if you Should not be the proper officer to appeal to on this question, you will we hope receive this as an expression, of the Sentiments of the loyal citizens of Simpson, for the Post Commander at Franklin,</p>
<p>If the thought of the removal of the troops from this place is based upon the fact that a portion of the 52<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Reg are necessarily Stationed at Scotville, and the additional fact that Scotville is in Gen Hobson's district, while Franklin is in yours, we would then Suggest that there Seems to us no impropriety in so changing the boundary of the Districts as to place Scotville &amp; Allen County in your District. and if necessary we will petition the proper<pb/>
<lb/>authorities to make Such change for the good of the loyal cause, certainly not because of any objection personally to that brave and excellent Officer &amp; gentleman Gen Hobson</p>

<p>This is respectfully referred to District Head-Quarters with the request that it be forwarded to the Governor of Kentucky Several, whose names appear to this petition, are personally know by me to be among the best loyal men in Simpson county, and I have it from undoubted authority that they are all truly loyal Union men, and law and order loving citizens I heartily endorse what they say of Major Johnson, and I regard the cancelling of his commission as an act of great injustice to a faithful vigilant officer I have been informed by the Judge Advocate of the court, that once had the charges against him under investigation, but which was dissolved before the trial was concluded that all the <hi rend="str">proof</hi> evidence adduced did not amount to any proof of criminality on the part of Johnson The certificate of the Judge Advocate will be forwarded in a day or two
