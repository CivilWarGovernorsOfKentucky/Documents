The Coroner held an inquest over him and found that he had been brutely murdered by Warren,, Warren took him and tied him to a tree and casterated him, then he cut off his left ear, and after torturing him he shot him twice once through then abdomen, then throug the head, stripped him of his clothing and left him. <persName ref="cwgk:N00005172">Adams</persName><pb/>
