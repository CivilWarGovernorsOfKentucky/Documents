<lb/>His Ex.
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Gov. J. F. Robinson</persName>
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>My young kinsman, <persName ref="cwgk:N00008527">J. Wm. Wallis</persName>, (whose <persName ref="cwgk:N00008529">Father</persName> resides in this <placeName ref="cwgk:P001031">County</placeName>,) has rendered himself greatly offensive to the rebellious &amp; traitorous element in &amp; about his neighborhood, for his activity, skill, daring &amp; management, at the head of some some forty or fifty of his young Companions, in ferretting out &amp; arresting rebels, capturing hordes, <hi rend="str">m</hi>&amp;C. belonging to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">U. States</orgName>. He &amp; his Father &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00011366">Brother</persName> have had to lie concealed in the mountainous portion of the state, for two months. Efforts have been made by various parties of rebel troops, to capture him &amp; his brave little volunteer partisan band of loyal young men. On his last trip to the hilly country, he discovered a drove of some 500 head of Cattle, left by the rebels, in their hasty retreat. </p>
<p>His friends, in common with myself, <hi rend="str">&amp;</hi>advise him <hi rend="underline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">to</hi> <hi rend="underline">put</hi> <hi rend="underline">a hand</hi> <hi rend="underline">to the capture of these</hi> <hi rend="underline">cattle</hi>, nor to take any other active measures, until he had a commission in his pockets, <hi rend="underline">which</hi> <hi rend="underline">will</hi> <hi rend="underline">render</hi> <hi rend="underline">his</hi> <hi rend="underline">acts</hi> <hi rend="underline">strictly</hi> <hi rend="underline">legal</hi> <hi rend="underline">&amp;</hi> <hi rend="underline">Military</hi>. Already threats are made against him &amp; band, as marauders, not being Employed by our Government. His Father is Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> M. Wallis of this County, a loyal gentle<pb/>
<lb/>and the son, J. Wm. is an Educated youth, of about 21 years of age, brave, rapid in movements, fertile in invention, &amp; Seems to possess many of the qualities of his Kinsman, (&amp; Cousin) the late <persName ref="cwgk:N00008535">Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Z. Taylor</persName>,</p>
<p>This paper is to solicit for him &amp; his officers, &amp; men, a <hi rend="underline">legal</hi> <hi rend="underline">recognition</hi> from you, so as to place him &amp; them ^&amp; their acts^ within the pale of legalized Warfare. He and his men are mounted on the best horses of their own, &amp; prefer to remain in the State, (&amp; Extended neighborhood, if possible) so that their services may be for their benefit.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008329">Judge Buckner</persName> can tell you more of him. If a commission as Capt of a Company of mounted Rangers can not be given by you, Would an admittance on your staff, with a Commission of authority as such from you, render his acts legal &amp; acceptable. Should a Commission to him &amp; his officers be granted, please allow me to ask the favor to suggest to you, that the Commissions be ante-dated, say to the <date when="1862-08-01">1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> of August<hi rend="str">u</hi> ^last,^</date> about which time <persName ref="cwgk:N00004777">Morgan</persName> first came in, so as to render his acts legal from that, date. -- He is jeopardizing his Safety, whilst acting by order of any of our Pro<hi rend="str">s</hi>vost Officers, -- I am happy to say that, Capt Wallis informs me that <persName ref="cwgk:N00008539">Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Gilmore</persName> fully Endorses the <unclear/> which would require a Commission for him to act.<pb/></p>
<p>Young Capt J. Wm. Wallis will present This letter in person to you.</p>
<p>With high regard
<lb/>Very truly
