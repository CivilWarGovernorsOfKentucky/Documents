<p>Maysville, Ky,
<lb/><date when="1861-02-22">Feb 22, 1861,</date>
<lb/>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>I am very glad to perceive that <persName ref="cwgk:N00014663">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rice</persName> has offered a reward for the capture of <persName ref="cwgk:N00014658">Sam'l M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Roberts</persName>, who escaped from your <orgName ref="cwgk:O00014664">jail</orgName> a few days since. He is one of the most daring, dangerous and desperate villains in all your region, and I fear the small reward that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rice has offered will be insufficient to induce any one to attempt his capture, especially as it cost so much to catch and bring him back before. <persName ref="cwgk:N00017279">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hawkins</persName> his security, had to pay more than 70$ for the assistance required in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001208">Cincinnati</placeName>.</p>
<p>He ought by all means to be had<pb/>
<lb/>and tried for he is so daring that your region and <placeName ref="cwgk:P00015169">Rowan</placeName>, will be in alarm all the time he remains loose and no property that ^can^ be run off will be safe.</p>
<p>... I suggest, therefore, that you as County Judge, write to the Governor, and request that he offer a reward of $250 or $300 in addition to what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rice has offered, for the re-capture of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Roberts. If you will state to him, the nature of the indictment and other charges against the felon, and the circumstances which make the case one of unusual importance, I have no doubt he will feel it his duty to offer some reward. I do not think the lives of <persName ref="cwgk:N00017280">Johnson</persName> &amp; Hawkins who took him the last time, are safe while he is loose, especially as he is supposed to have confederates in Rowan, who will secrete him any length of time in the hills, and afford him opportunities for any crime.</p>
<p>If you think it necessary, you may<pb/>
<lb/>enclose this letter to the Governor, to show him that I deem it necessary that a reward should be offered.</p>
<p>Your friend &amp;c
<lb/>R. H. Stanton</p>
<p>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N00014860">J. R. Garland</persName>
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00014653">Clarksburg, Ky</placeName>.<pb/></p>
<p>offer reward $200.
