<p>We the undersigned Union Men of Union County would respectfully ask the Governor of Kentucky T E Bramlet to remit the fine of seventy five dollars imposed on E B Mitchall at the <date when="--10">October term</date> of said Court we know Mitchall to be a true and loyal man and dont<hi rend="str">h</hi> think he should be made pay one cent for shooting D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> James D Ames. We know Ames and when <hi rend="str">he had his Rebells with him</hi> he is overbaring and verry abrusive Further we think Mitchell under the circumstances would have been justifiable had he killed Ames at the time</p>
