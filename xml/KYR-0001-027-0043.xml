<p>I certify on honor that <persName ref="cwgk:N00009747">Colin G. Gordon</persName> was acting as wagon master for the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00008814">28 Regiment Of Ky volunteers</orgName> from the <date when="1862-01-03">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of January 1862</date> until the <date when="1862-04-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of April 1862</date>. That the services of Mr. Gordon were faithfully rendered for the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Government</orgName> He had raised for the Regiment forty Eight men paid as recruits by Ric<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Menifee, and upon the Consolidation of the Regiment he was thrown out &amp; his men were placed in other Companies.</p>
<p>Thus- believing that there was to be a wagon master for the regiment I promised to Mr. Gordon that appointment he and I both believing it had to be filled. Accordingly when the wagons were furnished he was placed in charge of them and the teams and he had a great trouble and much exposure with the unbroken mules in verry bad weather -- His services were valuable to the Regiment and were faithfully rendered. It was our impression that the salary was forty Dollars per month</p>
