   <p>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos. E Bramlett</persName> Govenor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky</orgName>. The undersigned your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00012601">John W. Marques</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000938">Grant County</placeName> most respectfully states and represents that he became the bail of one <persName ref="cwgk:N00012530">John Neal</persName> upon his recognizance to answer to a charge of Felony in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000384">Grant Circuit Court</orgName> -- that soon after your petitioner became the bail of the said John Neal as aforesaid the said John Neal was notified and required by a large ^number of^ determined and dangerous men to leave and forever abandon Grant County and not return to it under the penalty of death. That had the said Neal remained in or returned to Grant County to answer to said charge it would have been at the peril of his life as almost the entire community in which he lived embracing portions of the Counties of Grat, <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002873">Harrison</placeName>. <placeName ref="cwgk:P001030">Scott</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004760">Owen</placeName> were greatly enraged and inflamed at and openly threatened his life upon his failing to leave or his return to Grant County. Neal abandoned the County, has never returned, did not appear<pb/>
<lb/>to answer said charge and at the <date when="1862-10">October Term 1862</date> of the Grant Circuit Court an order was made on motion of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00002811">Commonwealths attorney</persName> forfeiting said recognizance and at the <date when="1863-05">May Term 1863</date>, Judgment rendered thereon against your petitioner and said John Neal for Eight Hundred Dollars the amount of said bail bond and Execution is now in the hands of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00010953">Sheriff of Grant</persName> for collection returnable on the Fourth Monday of December next. Neal is worthless and has abandoned the state but would return but for the threats aforesaid. Your petitioner further states that although the judgment recites that a summons had been served upon the "<hi rend="underline">Defendants</hi>" that it was not served upon Neal but was returned by the sheriff of Grant not served as to Neal he files as part hereof copies of said order of forefeiture. Judgment. summons and return, Your petitioner is a poor man of Sixty Seven years of age whose estate consists of a poor hill farm in Grant County of Two Hundred acres, To compell him to pay said<pb/>
<lb/>Judgment would break him up and leave him in poverty to support himself and a large family of <hi rend="str">daug</hi> children and grand children one of them deaf and dumb and including the<persName ref="cwgk:N00012738"> wife </persName>^&amp; seven children^ of <persName ref="cwgk:N00012602">a son</persName> <hi rend="str">and seven children</hi> who is a soldier in the Federal service in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001507">Eighteenth Kentucky Regiment</orgName>, Wherefore he most respectfully requests your Excelency to remit so much of the Judgment as is <hi rend="str">in</hi> ^within^ your constitutional power to do.</p>
