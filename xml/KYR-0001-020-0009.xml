We hope your Excellency will review the case, and give the poor man the benefit of every doubt. &amp; we desire that his case may be judged in mercey &amp; regarded with favor, and that your Excellency will take into consideration, every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf, And we desire that your Excellency may be persuaded that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency, and that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon, or by a commutation of his punishment -- </p>
