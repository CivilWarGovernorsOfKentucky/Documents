<lb/>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">B, Magoffin</persName>
<lb/>Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Ky</orgName>,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>At the request of <persName ref="cwgk:N00021104">Mrs, Clark</persName> <hi rend="str">his</hi> <hi rend="str">mother</hi> I write you this, to state that I have known her as a resident of this City and <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000937">Cinti</placeName> for several years,</p>
<p>She has as I understand been a hard working woman and labored to support her fatherless children and raise them from mere infants.</p>
<p>One of her Sons, <hi><persName ref="cwgk:N00011808">D, W, Clark</persName></hi> is I understand now confined in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName> of Ky, for some offence agst. her Laws committed by him,</p>
<p>I have good reason to beleive that the young man wanting the more potent restraints of a father fell into bad company and finally if he committed the offence, it was done<pb/>
<lb/>under the influence of his unfortunate association with those, who, mature in crime, led him, a mere boy, from the path of honesty and virtue, to the commission of the crime charged.</p>
<p>I may suggest that if Executive Clemency should be exercised towards him there would be more hope of a reform than at the expiration of his term in the Penitentiary,</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/><hi rend="underline">C, H, Mooar</hi></p>
