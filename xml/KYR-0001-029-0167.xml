<p><milestone unit="column" n="1"/>Patrick Ford was stabbed in the lower part of the neck &amp; on the right side of the neck. It was not proven by Ford, (the only witness who testified) that the cutting was done with a <hi rend="underline">Knife</hi>, but the witness described the wound, (there was but <hi rend="underline">one</hi> wound) and the jury were instructed that although the witness <hi rend="str">could</hi>^did^ not swear that the cutting was done with a knife, they might draw their own conclusions from the evidence as to <hi rend="str">with</hi> what instrument the wound was inflicted with. The jury found the dft guilty as charged. Patrick Ford was the only witness &amp; was the person stabbed He stated that he had signed a paper (<hi rend="underline">made his mark</hi>) agreeing, a few days before the trial, not to appear against deft M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dermot but that at the time of the making his mark that he was <hi rend="underline">in liquor</hi>, &amp; did not state that this agreement was read to him before making his mark. <hi rend="underline">Under</hi> the circumstances, the fact that there was but one witness against M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dermot &amp; he the person stabbed, that malice was not proved but inferred by the jury I am disposed to sign this petition recommending the case of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dermot to your excellencys consideration &amp; mercy.</p>
