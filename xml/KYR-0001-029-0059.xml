<p>M. E. <hi rend="str">J.</hi> Robertson</p>

<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00017364">Wm Green</persName> P J R C C</p>
<p>Mr Price is a worthy citizen and it will be a hardship for him to have the fine to pay. He will have to pay the fee &amp; costs any way. Joseph E. Hays.</p>
<p>To his Excellency Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Robinson.</p>
<p>I supported Mr. M. E. Robertsons family while in the service until he drew wages. This was done through charity as I well knew I could never be remunerated unless out of his wages if he kept his health &amp; served. I loose much by his misfortune &amp; by furnishing his family in his absence when no one else would take the risk. The facts stated in the petition are all true &amp; I pray your Excelency to pardon the fine.</p>
