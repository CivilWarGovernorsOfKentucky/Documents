   <p>I write you at the earnest solicitation of my My Bro-Inlaw D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00009363">Samuel Maguire</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000542">Fleming County</placeName>, who is Capt of some 65 home guards -- who are the most Loyal men of the State, and who are entirely without arms. They have in two instances been called upon to meet a rebel force passing through their County &amp; the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000478">County of Bath </placeName>to join -- <persName ref="cwgk:N00000845">Humphrey Marshall</persName> -- many of them shouldered what squirrel rifles they could borrow from their neighbours with a warning of only a few hours -- many of them travelling on foot a distance of 40 miles in order to disperse the enemy, many of them applied to me in<pb/>
<lb/>person a few days sinse and desire if possible to have arms placed in their hands, so they can fight the battles of their Government &amp; State,</p>
<p>I know many of them personally, &amp; know that a truer or braver people does not inhabit this beautiful world of ours. Can you send them 50 stand of arms at once -- they are in my opinion entitled to them &amp; should receive them.</p>
<p>My Brother Inlaw D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Maguire will be responsible for th<hi rend="str">em</hi>e, safe return of the arms sent.
