   <p>To His Excellency James F Robinson Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Grant County would respectfully represent to Your excellency that at the present term of the Grant circuit Court J D Hutcherson was fined &#36;147 -- upon an indictment for stealing the horse of one Jos Kinslaer -- The Jury found him not guilty of the felony but found him guilty of a trespass to which he plead guilty. The evidence was that he took the horse of Kinslaer at night to get out of the way of some soldiers that he feared would arrest him -- that he went to the residence of A Morris a mile from Kinslaers in the road to New Liberty where he was going -- <pb/>
<lb/>called up Morris, told him he had Kinslaers horse &amp; requested him to go the next day &amp; tell his Hutchersons wife when he was gone -- She was at <unclear/> in sight of Kinslaers -- From there he went to the residence of one T J M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Ginnis in the <unclear/> road a mile &amp; a half from Kinslaers called him up &amp; told him he had Kinslaers horse &amp; requested him to go to Kinslaers the next day &amp; tell Kinslaer he had his horse &amp; would send it home -- He was overtaken by one of Kinslaers hands the same night &amp; gave up the horse &amp; the horse was returned to Kinslaer the same night- He is a very poor man -- We <hi rend="underline">think</hi> the fine extravegant<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; cruel- We therefore must respectfully ask that Your Excellency remit so much of said fine as you have the constitutional power to remit- Williamstown</p>
