Now your petitioners would further represent that said Richard Murray is a poor <hi rend="str">young</hi> man ^of family^ and is wholly unable to pay said fine. <hi rend="str">Who</hi> and that they believe his case is one in which the power your excellency has of remitting fines may be properly exercised he is unable to labor by reason of having accidently shot himself.</p>

<p>I could get any number of names to the petition but you can explain to the Gov that the petitioners -- live in Hammonsville the village where Dick lives. &amp; by citizens here he had a fight with John Thornsberry about which he was fined for having a pistol -- The Gov can see that John Thornsberry has signed the petition -- in War times like these I think every man ought to be allowed to wear weapons in fact I believe the law is repealed</p>
