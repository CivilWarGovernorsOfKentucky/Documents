   <p>Gov<persName ref="cwgk:N00000258"> B Magoffin</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
   <p>At your request I give you the facts (as I recollect them) in regard to the Petition of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000270">Doolin </persName>and <persName ref="cwgk:N00000271">Garner </persName>praying a remission of a fine against them, Doolin and Garner are Merchants at a little place called<placeName ref="cwgk:P00012215"> Salem </placeName>in the County of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000268">Pulaski</placeName>. At the <date when="1860-09">September Term 1860</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000269">Pulaski Circuit Court</orgName> they were fined for selling spiritous liquors without a license which drank on the premises. The evidence showed that they were allowed by law to sell the quantity they did sell but that it was drank on the adjacent premises. The witnesses introduced on behalf of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName> stated that he had bought the liquor; and drank it in the road in front of the store against ^the^ will and protestations of the Defendants, The road running in front of the store is the main public road from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001061">Somerset </placeName>to<placeName ref="cwgk:P00005569"> Crab Orchard</placeName>, This is their first and only offense, they are both poor but honest and worthy young men, I think that it is a case meriting executive Clemency. </p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
