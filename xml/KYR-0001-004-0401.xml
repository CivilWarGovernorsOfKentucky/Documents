<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Bramlette</persName>
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>You will recollect the case of Mr <persName ref="cwgk:N00004640">L. D. Cranniger</persName>, of this city who was the security of Capt <persName ref="cwgk:N00012630">Sharp</persName> who was indicted for <hi rend="underline">stealing</hi> a horse of one <persName ref="cwgk:N00012600">T. D. Kennedy</persName>. The horse was taken by Capt Sharp who was acting under Major <persName ref="cwgk:N00012599">Bocking</persName>-- who was acting under Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00009382">Leonidas Metcalf</persName>, who was acting under Genl <persName ref="cwgk:N00000879">Boyle</persName>, At one time Genl Boyle-- denied having authorised Col Mitcalf -- and then the whole thing fell to pieces-- You have doubtess seen the late letter of Col Metcalf<pb/>
<lb/>containing the very <unclear/> letter of Genl Boyle -- acknowledging-- that he had authorized Col Metcalf-- but had forgotten it, When Bocking was stopped by the Order from Genl Boyle-- every thing fell in <unclear>disaster</unclear>-- the sesesh every where <unclear/> prosecuted Sharp-- there are now six cases pending in this Court, for tresspass &amp; personal property arising out of this transaction. Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00005226">Carpenter</persName>, put this in the form of felony, so as to secure his attendance, Sharp gave Mr Croninger and getting frightened left-- At the present term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000410">Kenton Circuit Court</orgName> judgment was rendered against L. D. Cronniger for $200, Capt Sharp I understand is in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00015453">Eaton</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P001036">Ohio</placeName> <unclear>quite</unclear><pb/>
<lb/>low with bleeding of the lungs. I hope you will find it compatible with your duty as Governor to remit this fine. immediately, If the Capt had remained I have no doubt he would have been cleared, but being young he became frightened</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000460">John F, Fisk</persName><pb/></p>
<p>Remit except costs &amp; fees</p>
<p>Tho E Bramlette</p>
