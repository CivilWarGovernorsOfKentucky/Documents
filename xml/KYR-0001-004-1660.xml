   <p>To His Excellency the <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor</persName> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>Your Petitioner respectfully represents that three fines have been inflicted upon him in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000729">Lexington City Court</orgName>, of $15 each, which together with the costs, amount to $69.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">90</hi></hi> -- upon the charge of harboring three slaves without the consent of their <persName ref="cwgk:N00016384">Owner</persName>.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner says it is true that said negroes were found upon his premises, but that the Circumstance under which he received them, are such as to justify a hope that Your Excellency will interfere and remit said fines.</p>
<p>Your Petiti<persName ref="cwgk:N00016430">one</persName>r further represents that he is a colored man &amp; uneducated; that he has conducted himself uniformly as a law abiding man, and had no idea in this case that he was violating the law -- that part of these negroes claimed to be the wife and children of Federal Soldiers, claiming that under the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">United States</orgName> laws, they were free -- that your petitioner was told by Federal Soldiers and Officers, that they <hi rend="underline">were</hi> <hi rend="underline">free</hi>, &amp; that your petitioner run no risk in taking them into his house; and that he not only thought he had a right to do so, but that it was his duty to assist them -- one of them coming to his house sick and remaining in bed as long as she stayed there.</p>
