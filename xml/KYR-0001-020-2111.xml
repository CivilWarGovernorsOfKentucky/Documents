<lb/>the &#36;500 -- went to Indiana to get his said Brother to come and entered his appearance in discharge of his said Bond in Bond of this petitioner -- and found him unable to make his appearance from his health -- hence the Bond was forfeited by an order of the Boyd circuit Court -- and a summins has hence issued against your petition to <unclear>recover</unclear> the &#36;500 -- Now in consideration of the premises he asks your excilency to remit him from the said penal<hi rend="str">ity</hi>ty on the following ground -- He states that the condition of the country by the Civil War which has distroyed every thing in a manner on the sandy waters which he with others has had to <unclear>buar</unclear> -- the deplorable devastations has become noted as among the worst that has attened the civil War Nelson and his Brigade -- and <unclear>Wetcher</unclear> and his band of pirates that stole and devasted what they could reach -- and last and not least of the scourges the flood in sandy River has swept almost the balance farms sadly ruined -- in this condition starvation is almost the consequence what little property is left without price -- he is unable to meet the same he asks your excellency to discharge him from the said penalty intercourse has been prevented with Indiana or his said Brother -- for some time unsafe<pb/>
<lb/>to travel -- but little doubt but that his brother is in the army -- or he would again seek for him to appear -- unless your excellency will remit the said penalty he will be forced by judgent of the Boyd circuit court to answer the penalty -- he thinks he has had his shear of troubles as aforesaid he asks in mercy &amp;c</p>
<p>Alvius Mainor</p>
