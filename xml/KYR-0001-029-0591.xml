   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">James F. Robinson</persName> Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName>:</p>
   <p>The undersigned citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001874">Campbell County</placeName> respectfully represent that <persName ref="cwgk:N00004719">George Coy</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00004721">Jacob Hawthorn</persName> stand bound upon two bonds as sureties for one <persName ref="cwgk:N00004718">F. S. Grismier</persName> to keep the peace and as the bonds read for the appearance of the sad Grismier at the next <unclear/> Term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000361">Campbell Circuit Court</orgName> upon which bonds the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">ths</hi></hi> atto is asking a forfeiture upon the ground that Grissnier did not make his appearance at Court-- there is no complaint that Grisnier did any thing to break the peace but on the contrary he was a law abiding peaceful citizen and we are satisfied that Coy &amp; Hawthorn signed the bonds under the apprehension that they were only to be responsible in case that Grisnier committed a breach of the peace &amp; that they did not understand that they were to be respoonsible for his appearance at Court-- We think it a proper case for his interfering clemency of the Executive &amp; ask that they the said Coy &amp; Hawthorn be relieved from the effects of the bonds if within the power of the Governor to do so--</p>
   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00004720">E. W. Hawkins</persName><pb/></p>
<p>Pettn for remission of bonds of George Coy &amp; Jacob Hawthorn from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004717">Newport</placeName></p>
<p>Held for further advice</p>
<p>I am unwilling to interfere before judgt. It is a very bad precident which I have never set</p>
<p>Remit except fees &amp; costs
