   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">B. Magoffin</persName>,
<lb/>Governor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky</orgName>:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner, <persName ref="cwgk:N00020468">Patrick Donnelly</persName>, would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1860-01">January Term of the Jefferson Circuit Court, in the year 1860</date>, he was tried upon an Indictment against him, for the Killing of <gap/> <persName ref="cwgk:N00021123">Scott</persName>, and that he was found guilty of the crime of Manslaughter, and sentenced to the Jail and <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName> of this Commonwealth for the Term of Ten Years. -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioner now prays your Excellency for a Pardon for the following causes:</p>
<p>1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> The true statement of the circumstances attending the unfortunate wounding did not, and <hi rend="underline">could</hi> not be brought before the Jury. -- Your Petitioner is now a mere youth, about Eighteen years of age; the wounding occurred on <date when="1858-12-25">Christmas day 1858</date>. -- Your Petitioner and <gap/> Scott were and always had been intimate and devoted personal friends; had been intimate as boys, and were at that time mere boys; they had never had a difficulty or an angry word, or thought between them. -- On that day they had, unfortunately, been together celebrating that festival in the usual manner by drinking, and being unaccustomed to the use of intoxicating liquors, they both became drunk<pb/>
<lb/>Even to insanity; a foolish quarrel, about some matter so trivial that your Petitioner has never been Enabled since to remember, Ensued, and the result of that quarrel was that your Petitioner, as it appeared, <hi rend="str">stabbed</hi> without any provocation, stabbed the deceased, with a pen Knife, in the thigh. -- Your Petitioner states that he has no distinct recollection of the unfortunate occurrence, but he does state, most solemnly, that at the time the wound was inflicted, and never before did he enteratin one particle of hostility to his deceased friend, and that he did not Know, until some time afterwards, that he had cut him, and that when informed of it he could not credit it. -- </p>
<p>2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Your Petitioner states that death from the wound was a mere accident. -- The Phemoral artery -- by an untoward accident -- happened to be severed, and the position of the parties showed that Your Petitioner had <hi rend="underline">any</hi> and <hi rend="underline">all</hi> chances to have inflicted a wound upon any portion of the body of the deceased which would have been <hi rend="underline">necessarily</hi> <hi rend="underline">vital</hi> instead of a cut in the leg -- </p>
<p>3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Your Petitioner states that Scott lived for some days after the wounding, and, as was proven on the trial, said that he believed the wounding was accidental, and that he did not desire a prosecution against Petitioner. -- That there was no<pb/>
<lb/>ill feeling between them, and that he knew there was no intent to injure him. -- </p>
<p>4<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Your Petitioner states that as an Expiation for the offense of drunkeness and its lamentable consequences, he has suffered confinement in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001161">Jail</orgName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001005">Jefferson County</placeName> for many weary months; that he has been convicted as a felon and immersed in the walls of the Penitentiary since last January, and he most respectfully suggests that by all the principles of Justice, not to say Mercy, he has made atonement for his wrong. -- </p>
<p>5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi>. Your Petitioner states that he is yet a minor, too young to be deprived of all hopes to make reputation for himself, and perform services to his <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Country</orgName>; that he has an aged <persName ref="cwgk:N00020469">mother</persName>, in a great measure dependant upon his labor for the comforts -- Even the necessaries -- of her declining life, and he feels that his offence, however disastrous to his future prospects, is not so great as to warrant any further term of imprisonment</p>
<p>Your Petitioner therefore for many reasons not Enumerated herein, as well as for the causes herein assigned, most respectfully and urgently begs your Excellency to give a favorable hearing to this Petition and grant a Pardon for the offence above named, and as in duty he will Ever pray &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi><pb/></p>
