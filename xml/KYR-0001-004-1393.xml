   <p>His Excellency Gov
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos E Bramlette</persName>,<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>At the present <date when="1864-12">December Term 1864</date>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00006240">David Whitehouse</persName>-- was convicted under two indictments for selling liquor to two Minors-- one <persName ref="cwgk:N00006242">John Cure</persName>-- the other C. <unclear>Sandfass</unclear>-- On the trial of Cure-- defendant produced and proved by the Father of <persName ref="cwgk:N00006242">John Cure</persName>-- that in the year <date when="1862">1862</date> -- he had given Dr Whitehouse a written authority to sell his sons <persName ref="cwgk:N00006241">Ferdinand</persName> and John Whatever they wanted. Whitehouse kept a Tavern and would not permit the boys to drink liquor without the order -- which the father gave -- The Judge construed the law-- that there must be written authority for <hi rend="underline">every</hi> sale -- that a <hi rend="underline">general</hi> authority would not shield the defendant and therefore he was fined-- and immediately replevied the debt -- </p>
<p>Precisely the same state of facts existed as to C. <unclear>Sandfass</unclear>-- under the same instructions he was fined $50 -- in each case-- the undersigned <persName ref="cwgk:N00000460">John F. Fisk </persName>defendant-- and the undersigned<persName ref="cwgk:N00006448"> J. R Hallam</persName> prosecuted as Commonwealth Pro Tem -- We think this a fair case for Executive Clemency, Evidently the Landlord and both the parents did what they thought was a compliance with the law -- </p>
<p>John F, Fisk</p>
<p>I make no recommendation but the facts are correctly set out in the above</p>
