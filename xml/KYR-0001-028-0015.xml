<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor</persName>,</p>
<p>At the time of the first call of the <persName ref="cwgk:N001760">President</persName> for volunteers, several citizens of this city immediately volunteered in the famous <orgName ref="cwgk:O00010713">Ninth Ohio Regiment</orgName> under the lamented Robert L. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cook, there being no Kentucky regiments then in the field.</p>
<p>Among these are prominent:
<lb/>Lieutenant <persName ref="cwgk:N00010715">Friedrich Bertsch</persName>,<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00010716">Charles Haebe</persName><lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00010717">E. A. H. Beyland</persName>, and others.</p>
<p>These men have shared all the dangers of the severe campaign of Western <placeName ref="cwgk:P001037">Virginia</placeName>, and partook in the splendid Bayonet Charge, which decided the day at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00010718">Mill Springs</placeName>, where Kentuckians participated in the glory. They are "Military Men.", the Lieutenant having served in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001022">Germany</placeName> for a number of years, and the other two having acquired their knowledge during the present war.</p>
<p>It is my opinion, and confident belief, that with these men as officers, this section of Kentucky can in a liberal time, (say 5 weeks)<pb/>
<lb/>raise, and have in camp a regiment of as good men as ever fought for our <placeName ref="cwgk:P001802">country</placeName>.</p>
<p>The regiment would be exclusively German, who would flock under the banner of these well tried men with alacrity from all parts of our state. The purpose of this letter is to communicate to you these facts, and, as the men are Kentuckians by adoption to get them released from <placeName ref="cwgk:P001036">Ohio</placeName> authority by apppointment to the different commands of the new regiment.</p>
<p>The position of Colonel could be filled with great ability by the above named Lieutenant Friedrich Bertsch.</p>
<p>Commissions to recruit companies could be given to E. A. H. Beyland, Charles Haebe, and others who might be subsequently designated by Col. Bertsch.</p>
<p>As the time is short, and as necessity requires immediate action, I would earnestly recommend to your Honor, the appointment of these men, to raise the regiment, which might be called the first German Kentucky Infantry.</p>
<p>Their transfer could no doubt be procured from the <persName ref="cwgk:N00005318">Governor of Ohio</persName>, for such a purpose.<pb/></p>
<p>In anticipation of favorable action upon this matter, I await your reply.</p>
<p>I have the honor to remain with great respect,</p>
<p>Your obedient servant

<p>Hon. James F. Robinson
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> Ky.</p>
<p>N.B. <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> The above letter written by a German friend for my signature I must hearily approve -- Such a regiment can be formed &amp; will add to the glory of our army -- The officers named can bring a greater power to bear than any others that we know of. but others no doubt can be found -- If you approve of the suggestions of this letter telegraph me &amp; I will put preliminaries at once in motion -- It is desirable that we should have any part of the state in which to <unclear/> the regiment </p>
