   <p>State of Kentucky, <placeName ref="cwgk:P001786">Clark County </placeName>Sct</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00017087">Andrew J. Snowden </persName>of said County &amp; State being sworn according to law, says</p>
<p>First, That at the <date when="1860-11">November Term 1860</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000364">Clark Circuit Court</orgName>, he was indicted upon charge of Carrying Concealed deadly weapon- which is still pending That <persName ref="cwgk:N00017093">Richard Allen</persName> of said County became at his instance his surety in bail bond for his appearance in Court</p>
<p>Second That at the <date when="1863-07">July Term 1863</date> of the said Court, his recognizance was forfeited under the following State of case, to wit That he left his residence in the morning early of the first day of said term of Court for <placeName ref="cwgk:P001792">Winchester </placeName>the County seat of Clark County to appear at the call of the Docket, and when he had reached in 2 <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">2</hi> miles of the Court house, he was informed by several persons that the Rebels were in Winchester or close thereto, and engaged in pressing or Stealing horses indiscriminately, and upon the information thus received he returned home as there seemed in his judgment from what he deemed reliable information good foundation to do as he did as he did not want as a Union man either to be injured in his person or have his Horse stolen from him, That he has appeared since to wit at the <date when="1863-11">November Term 1863</date> of said Court, and<pb/>
<lb/>the Cause was continued at the instances of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName>, That he does not and never has feared the result of his case upon trial, and his failure to appear at the <date when="1863-07">July Term 1863</date> of the Clark Circuit Court, was not in anywise to evade trial a judgment, as he has been ready at all times to be amenable to the Court and Laws of the Country, That I am a poor man without any means of any Kind,</p>
