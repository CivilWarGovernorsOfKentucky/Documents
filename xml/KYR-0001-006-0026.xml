<lb/><date when="1864-03-16">March 16, 1864.</date>
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor Bramlette</persName>:</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00014853">Wm. Ross</persName> perpetrated the most outrageous murder on the person of <persName ref="cwgk:N00020657">Wm. H. Kelly</persName>, in this county, in <date when="1859-07">July, 1859</date>. There had been some dispute between the parties about the sale of a tract of land. Kelly was plowing in his field, not knowing that any one was near him. Ross concealed himself in ambush near the fence, and as Kelly turned his plow at the end of the furrow, Ross shot him in the back with his gun, from long range, and killed him instantly.</p>
<p>Ross was indicted for murder, arrested and put in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00020655">Gallatin County Jail</orgName>. He only remained in Jail a short time when he broke the jail and made his escape. The <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Governor</persName> offered a reward of $250. and some parties captured him on <geogName ref="cwgk:G00009737">Big Sandy</geogName>, near the <placeName ref="cwgk:P001037">Virginia</placeName> line.</p>
<p>He was brought back here in placed in Jail again, where he remained some months, when by the aid of some accomplices outside, he had a hole made through the entire wall of the Jail and escaped again, and is now at large in the State of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001883">Missouri</placeName>.</p>
   <p>At the instance of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00020658">father</persName> of the deceased I send you the request of our <persName ref="cwgk:N00002278">Circuit Judge</persName>, asking you to offer another reward for his arrest -- and also make a riquisition upon the <persName ref="cwgk:N00020430">Governor</persName> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018723">Missouri</orgName> for his return.<pb/>
<lb/>I send also a certified copy of the indictment, and request that you will appoint <persName ref="cwgk:N00019704">Wm. Sams</persName>, of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000697">Carrollton</placeName>, Ky. Agent on behalf of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State of Kentucky</orgName>. I know Mr. Sams to be active and faithful, and has lately been engaged to some extent in this business.</p>
<p>Please send the Papers to me at Carrollton, as I will be there at <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000365">Court</orgName> in a few days.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully,
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00002277">John L. Scott</persName>,
