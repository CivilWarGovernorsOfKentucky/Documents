   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette</persName>
<lb/>Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001845">Union county</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName> will represent to your Excellency that <persName ref="cwgk:N00019046">Mathew Spalding</persName> (of Color) was fined fifty dollars by the Police Court of the town of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001832">Morganfield</placeName> in said county for carrying concealed a deadly weapon. Said fine was imposed on the <date when="1865-08-27">27 day of August 1865</date>.</p>
<p>They respectfully recommend said boy and his case to the Executive clemency, upon these grounds, towit Mathew whilst a Slave and since his liberation has always been a first rate character for honesty and good demeanor. He is and has been all the year faithfully at work trying to support himself and his family, -- consisting of <persName ref="cwgk:N00019047">a wife</persName> and two small children.</p>
<p>He was in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">U. S army</orgName> and, like nearly all the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000740">negro soldiers</orgName>, was induced to buy a pistol when discharged.</p>
<p>The subscribers are credibly informed that at<pb/>
<lb/>the time the offence was committed he has the pistol on his person with the sole view of selling it.</p>
<p>Upon these considerations the undersigned request and hope that Your Excellency will remit his fine.</p>
