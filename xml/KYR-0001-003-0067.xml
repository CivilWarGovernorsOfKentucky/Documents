   <p>His Excellency -- 
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Gov Bramlette</persName></p>
<p>The high standing and Known loyalty of the signers of the accompanying petition forbid that I should refuse to comply with their request to forward it to you -- </p>
<p>I know you have already done your whole duty in the effort to relieve <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName> from these troubles &amp; disturbances.</p>
<p>Each signer of this petition is a good &amp; true Union man -- In addition to this petition I have recd this enclosing various letters from loyal Citizens of Christian County appealing to me to do something for their relief. All represent a most desperate state of feeling among the loyal citizens of<pb/>
<lb/>that truly loyal <hi rend="str">citizens</hi> ^County^ Utter ruin is impending -- indeed I may say is already upon them.</p>
<p>They say that the negroes going off from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001918">Christian County</placeName> by droves are met at the State line by armed <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">soldiers</orgName> &amp; escorted to the recruiting <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018492">Camp at Clarksville</orgName> and furthermore they are satisfied that secret recruiting agents are at work throughout that part of Ky.</p>
<p>My information from the <persName ref="cwgk:N00002647">Secty of War </persName>was that the establishment of these recruiting camps for negroes in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tenn</placeName> was left altogether to the discretion of the local military authorities and in view of this fact I suggest that an appeal to <persName ref="cwgk:N00002299">Genl<pb/>
<lb/>Rousseau</persName> <hi rend="str">&amp; &amp;</hi> and <persName ref="cwgk:N001002">Gov Johnson</persName> might have <hi rend="str">to</hi> some effect.</p>
<p>I am most Respctly
<lb/>Yr Obt Svt
