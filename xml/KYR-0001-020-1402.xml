<lb/>To his Excellency, 
<lb/>Governor <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName>.<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort. Ky.</placeName></p>
   <p>The undersigned petitioner most repectfully States, that at the <date when="1861-04">April Term, 1861</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001838">City court of Louisville</orgName>, a fine of <hi rend="underline">Sixty dollars,</hi> was imposed upon him, by said court, for an alleged assult upon <persName ref="cwgk:N00005505"><hi rend="underline">John Creagh</hi></persName>, of this city.</p>
   <p>Your petitioner, states most solemnly that the <hi rend="underline">true facts</hi>, of the case are these, He says, that he owed Creagh. a Small amount of money. for some small articles purchased of him, by his <persName ref="cwgk:N00002899">Long<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Wife</persName>, and that he gave the money to his Wife, to pay John Creagh, and supposed Creagh had been paid months before the difficulty mentioned in the indictment.</p>
<p>That when the difficulty occured petitioner, was standing near the Post office in Louisville, &amp; was accosted by Crea<hi rend="str">h</hi>gh,, and asked for the money. He told Creagh, that he had given the amount to petitioners Wife, to pay him, and thought it had been done, But as Creagh, said he had not been paid, by M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Long. If he Creagh, would call down at the office of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00005504">N. S. Long. &amp; Bro</orgName>. he would be paid, immediately. Creagh, then began to abuse petitioner, and called him a <hi rend="underline">Villian</hi>, a <hi rend="underline">Scoundrel</hi>. &amp;c.
<lb/><hi rend="underline">over</hi>.<pb/></p>
<p>And Swore that he Creagh, would publish him wherever he went in the city, as Such. &amp;c. Your petitioner said to Creagh, that he wanted no difficulty with him, but no man living, should apply such epithets to him. and that <hi rend="underline">too, with out</hi> cause or proof to sustain them, Creagh, then <hi rend="underline">advanced</hi> towards petitioner, with his cane <hi rend="underline">uplifted</hi>, and your petitioner wrested the Cane from him, and Struck Creagh <hi rend="underline">Twice with his fist</hi>. </p>
<p>John Creagh, was the <hi rend="underline">only witness</hi> in the case, <hi rend="underline">no other person</hi> being present, until after it occured. Your petitioner is a <hi rend="underline">Law abiding man,</hi> and does not believe now, that he done <hi rend="underline">more or less</hi>, than he ought to have done, under the circumstances. after he had been called a Villian, and Soundrel. by Creagh,</p>
<p>In view of the facts, in this case all of which I have mentioned truthfully, Your petitioner asks very respectfully of your Excellency, to <hi rend="underline">remit said fine</hi></p>
