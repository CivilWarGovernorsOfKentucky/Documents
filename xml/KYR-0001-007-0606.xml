<lb/>Hon E. L. Van Winkle
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Please do me the favor to send me a Commission as Notary Public A number of the lawyers here are desirous to have me appointed so that they may have proofs, depositions &amp;c taken before me, I am Commissioner for nearly all of the States and being a notary will obviate the necessity of getting the appointment for several of these States -- I have heard nothing more from Hopper., Am anxious to get our lands all in shape &amp; to send them on to Judge Watson as soon as possible I confidently believe that this interest will prove to be far more valuable to you than your interest in the Cumberland River Coal Co, and if we can get the lands all in marketable shape. I believe we can dispose of them within a month from the time they are set to New York for sale</p>
<p>Yours truly N. R. Wilson<pb/></p>
<p>Notary Public
