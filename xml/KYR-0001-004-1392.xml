   <p>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas E Bramlette</persName> Governor of the<orgName ref="cwgk:O001025"> Commonwealth of Kentucky</orgName></p>

That some time last Spring a man named Douthett applied to him at his office for a marriage License -- stating that the woman he was about to marry had seperated from her former husband and ^and had been seperated for about five years. and^ had brought suit agst him for a Divorce</p>
<p>Petitioner advised him to wait until the Divorce was granted. Douthett <unclear>assentd</unclear> &amp; went away Some time after this he again applied to Peti<hi rend="sup">r</hi> for License and he ignorant that any penalty attached to him even tho the Lady whom sd Douthett proposed to marry had not been divorced, ignorantly issued the License -- For this he has been indicted -- He made no defence, the facts being as stated &amp; the aforsd Judgt was rendered agst him -- He declares he committed the foregiong impropriety alone from ignorance of his duty &amp; the law in the premises and from no hope promise or agreement of reward therefor other than the legal fee for issuing license &amp;c<pb/>
<lb/>He therefore earnestly prays Yr Ex<hi rend="sup">cy</hi> to remit to him the fine &amp; Judgt aforsaid -- as he is very poorly able to pay the same, if it were even proper to enforce it</p>
<p>And as in duty &amp;c
