   <p>His Excellency Governor Robinson</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Moses Mullins says that at the <date when="1861-03">March Term 1861</date> of the Laurel Circuit court he was fined &#36;15 for an alledgd disturbance of Religious Worship. and afterwards upon petition he obtained a respite thereon, which expired on the <gap/> day of <date when="1863">1863</date> -- He now repeats all the statements made in his original petition and says they are true, he did not intend to disturb the meeting, and he was wholey unable to pay said fine, but replevied the same, and the sheriff is now endeavring to coerce the same out of his surities -- and he is less able to pay now than he was at the time of the respite -- that the rebel army last fall under Kirby Smith took from him pretty much all he had which was but little, but that little greatly needed for the support of his family, and his neighbors fared about the same way -- He says the fine cannot possibly be paid without serious oppression, altho' it is Small -- he therfore prays your Excellency to remit it -- </p>
<p>Moses Mullins</p>
