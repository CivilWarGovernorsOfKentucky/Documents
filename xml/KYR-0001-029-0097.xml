   <p>To His Excellency, <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor of Kentucky</persName>.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00017557">Charles Kremer</persName> a citizen of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> respectfully represents that on the <date when="1862-08-18">18<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of August 1862</date>, he entered in a recognizance in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001838">City Court of Louisville</orgName> as security for one <persName ref="cwgk:N00017564">Patrick Ryan</persName> in the sum of Three Hundred Dollars; the object of the recognizance being to compel said Ryan to keep the peace and be of good behavior for six months. Petitioner says that Ryan broke his bond by having committed an assault on a negro man named <persName ref="cwgk:N00017565">James H Lewis</persName>; he thereby forefeited the bond. The injury done to Lewis was very inconsiderable, But not-with-standing proceedings are being had in said Court to subject petitioner to a payment of the recognizance. Petitioner states that he entered into the bond, alone from the motives of friendship, he having been a class mate of said Ryan. Petitioner was born and raised in this City, and has always pursued an industrious and peacable lilfe, and is unable to pay<pb/>
<lb/>the bond if it is exacted of him. If the Judgement is enforced against him, he will be compelled to go to the work-house, thereby depriving his family of support; he has a <persName ref="cwgk:N00017566">wife</persName> and three children. He therefore prays your Excellency to relieve him from paying said bond. He files herewith a copy of the Proceedings of the City Court against him.</p>
<p>On the <date when="1862-10-06">6th of October 1862</date> a Judgment was rendered in the City Court of Louisville, in the case set forth in the foregoing petition. <hi rend="str">Charles</hi> Twenty five dollars has been paid, by defts. Mr Kremer is a young man of family -- poor and industrious, and considering all the circumstances, attending his case, I cordially Join with him in asking for remission of the Judgment. He became involved for a friend, without reward.</p>
<p>Respectfully

<lb/>City attorney</p>
<p>I concur with Mr Reasor in recommending the remission as to Kremer.</p>
