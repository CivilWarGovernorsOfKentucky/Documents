<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1854-03">March Term 1854</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000576">Scott Circuit Court</orgName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00018320">Jordan</persName>, a <persName ref="cwgk:N00018321">slave</persName>, then belonging to <persName ref="cwgk:N00018232">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> R M Erving</persName> was tried upon an indictment for the murder of another slave, and was found guilty of manslaughter. The punishment was commuted by <persName ref="cwgk:N00000830">Gov. Powell</persName>, to imprisonment for life in the penitentiary, where the slave has been ever since, <hi rend="str"><unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/></hi></p>
<p>After such a lapse of time it could not be expected that either of the undersigned, (one of whom was the presiding Judge, and the other, counsel of the prisoner) would be able to state with accuracy or in detail, the facts of the case as proved on the trial. We do remember, however, the leading features of the case, and can now state, that although accending to strict law, the proof was perhaps sufficient to make out a case of manslaughter, yet, if the prisoner had been a free white citizen of respectable standing, it would have been a fair case <hi rend="str">of</hi>for acquittal. The persons composing<pb/>
<lb/>the jury are among our most respectable citizens, and although they felt constained to render the verdict they did, they were actively instrumental in procuring the commutation of the punishment</p>
<p>In view of the nature of the case, of of the long confinement of Jordan, and of the character he has sustained both before and since his conviction, we do not hesitate to request that your Execllency would exercise in his favor the power of pardon as now provided by law. </p>
<p>Very respectfully &amp;c
