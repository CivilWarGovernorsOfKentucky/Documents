<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos E, Bramlet</persName>
<lb/>Go<hi rend="sup">v</hi> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kenty</orgName>
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>In behalf of the Officers &amp; men of this regt I address you this letter relative to the appointment of a Lieut Col to fill the vacancy occassioned by the regination of <persName ref="cwgk:N00005792">A J Alexander</persName>,</p>
<p>It is the earnest desire of boath officers &amp; men that Maj. ^<persName ref="cwgk:N00011728">Milton^ Graham</persName> be commissioned Lt Co<hi rend="sup">l</hi> &amp; Capt <persName ref="cwgk:N00020034">Frederick Slater</persName> be commissioned Maj vice Graham, But if Graham does not accept the appointment of Lt Co<hi rend="sup">l</hi> thus the regt ardently desires that Capt Slater be commissioned Lieut Co<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, However petitions have already been sent you signed by every officer in the regt present save Maj Boyle &amp; two others, to this effect,</p>
<p>Boath Maj Graham &amp; Capt Slater have the undivided confidence of the regt and they have upon all occasions where danger presented it self acted the part of deliberate skilful &amp; brave officers, I do trust for the good of the regt &amp; the cause in which it is engaged you will most favorably consider their claims to promotion</p>
<p>It has been rumored in Camp that Maj <persName ref="cwgk:N00020036">W O boyle</persName> will be L<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Col Now Go<hi rend="sup">v</hi> I do not wish to speak disrespectfully of Maj Billy Boyle for I have (found him to be a very cleaver little boy. But I do not hesitate to express my beliefs that his appointment will be disastrous to the regt You are fully aware<pb/>
<lb/>that the success of a regiment greately depends upon the confidence placed by the subordinates in their commander And I assure you that precious little if any confidence is placed in Maj<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Boyle by the officers &amp; men of this regt in comparison to Maj Graham or Capt Slater</p>
<p>I suppose there are not half a dozen officers in the regt who recognized a superior in Maj Boyle in point of inteligence, bravery Military Skills or every thing else of worth, They only recognize the unfortunate fact that luck has placed him in possession of a Major<hi rend="sup">s</hi> commission,</p>
<p>Go<hi rend="sup">v</hi> I write this not that I have any ^personal^ ill feeling for Maj Boyle but because it is right that you should be apprised of his disrepute in the regt which togather with his want of age &amp; experience renders him unfit for the responsible position of L<hi rend="sup">t</hi> col</p>
<p>I am Go<hi rend="sup">v</hi> with much respt
<lb/>Your Friend
