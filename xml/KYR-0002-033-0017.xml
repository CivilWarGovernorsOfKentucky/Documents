<lb/>To His Excellency
    <lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos. E Bramlette</persName>
    <lb/>Gov. of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
   <p>Permit Me to trouble you with a few lines, at the same time making a request. I am a Native of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort Ky</placeName>. and a resident of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001842">Lancaster Ky</placeName>. I served under Col. <persName ref="cwgk:N00005137">Woolford</persName> in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00005136">first Ky. cavalry</orgName> about one year as second Lt. and then under Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00005765">Watkins</persName> in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009378">Sixth cavalry</orgName> for nearly two years as a first Lieut. I am now in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00005307">Navy</orgName> as a private enlisted with the positive understanding from Cap. <persName ref="cwgk:N00005766">Bowen</persName> at Cinti, that I was to be promoted in a very short time. I enlisted for two years but have heard nothing of promotion since. I was transfered to this Hospital in Sep. last sick and when I was well enough they placed me on duty as clerk I have a family to support and my pay is only &#36;20 -- pr month and that will not support any one <hi rend="str">an</hi>person<pb/></p>
   <p>My object in writing was to request that you would commission me in some Ky Regt where there is a vacancy. I think after having served as long as I did in the army and then one year in the navy that I either might be relieved either with a commission or discharge and their is no probability of my getting a discharge under one year, unless I get a Commission I must remain where I am at. and in that case my family must suffer. for I can not ever get the small amount of pay that is promised me until my time is out. I think Gov. if you could grant me a commission however small you would never regret it. and Sir I would owe you a debt of Gratitude that I could never repay. as for my character &amp;c I would refer you to <persName ref="cwgk:N00003472">A. C. Keenon</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00009567">Joseph Clark</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00009566">J. B. Akin</persName> of Frankfort. Also Major <persName ref="cwgk:N001778">J. R. Page</persName> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002616">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky cavalry</orgName> Hoping Gov. that you will decide in my favor and send me a commission at <hi rend="str">the</hi>your earliest <hi rend="str">possible</hi>convinence I am Sir</p>
