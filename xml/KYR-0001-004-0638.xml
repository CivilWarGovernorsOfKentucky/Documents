   <p>To Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlett Governor of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName></p>
<p>Your Petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00004889">Alanson Trigg</persName> respetfully represents to your Excellency, that he has been indicted &amp; fined in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000585">Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court</orgName> for permitting as was alledged two negro men slaves to go at large &amp; to hire themselves as will more fully &amp; at large appear from copies of the Indictment &amp; judgment herewith filed &amp; presented as part hereof. Your Petitioner conceives that he has been persecuted &amp; badly treated in this proceeding He could not owing to the condition of the County well bring these negroes from <placeName ref="cwgk:P001020">Warren</placeName> to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000558">Barren County</placeName>, in ^which^ your petitioner resides. <hi rend="str">Both</hi> ^Each^ of them had <hi rend="str">wives</hi> ^a wife^ in Warren County near a farm owned by this Petitioner for many years &amp; on which he had kept his slaves. On selling his farm he did not want to sell his slaves &amp; allowed them to remain in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001020">Warren</placeName> out of humanity. But he placed them in the care &amp; control of <persName ref="cwgk:N00004977">John Petty</persName> and W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> G Hendrick who promised to take care of &amp; manage them as their own &amp; if the law has been violated your Petitioner says others &amp; not he violated it. Your Petitioner avers that there are not better behaved &amp; more honest slaves any where to be found than the two mentioned in the Indictment &amp; he humbly asks your Excellency to remit the fine imposed upon him</p>

<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> A Trigg was not at the last term of the Equity &amp; Criminal Court of Warren County when the within mentioned Indictment was tried As attorney I defended him. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Petty &amp; Mr Hendrick were witnesses &amp; in substance stated that the slaves had been put under their control by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Trigg that is <persName ref="cwgk:N00011096">one of the slaves</persName> under the control of Mr Petty &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00011097">the other</persName> under the control of Mr Hendrick The jury I thought ought not to have convicted &amp; I request that the Governor will remit the fine</p>

<p>We unite in the above request</p>

<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00003596">R C Logan</persName></p>
<p>The negroes spoken of in the Petition are old men- &amp; have been of little or no use to Mr Trigg for years. I presume the Indictments originated from the ill feeling of some of the neighbors for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Trigg -- The same privileges are given many other negroes in the town &amp; country=I therefore join the this Petition</p>
