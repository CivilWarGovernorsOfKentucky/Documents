<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>There are 198 muskets of a lot sent to me by Doctor <persName ref="cwgk:N00002591">Blackburn</persName> when he was in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000918">Mississippi </placeName>that ought to be retained in the State if possible and I don't see why they should get into the hands of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">Union party</orgName> -- They are first rate guns and in fine order- Smooth bore but heavy barrels and suitable for rifling -- When they arrived supposing them to belong to the State I collected of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000403">Mr Brannin</persName> about $160 to pay freight &amp;c -- The Doctor wants to turn part of them over to a company going South and I have told him he must get your order for them which is not treating him very cleverly as all the State is out on them is the $160 above named -- He of course is entitled to the guns provided he returns the $160, under Gov.<persName ref="cwgk:N00006279"> Pettis</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000918">Mississippi </placeName>meant them as a present to the State- about that you may know -- </p>
