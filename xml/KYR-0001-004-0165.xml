<p>I address you from this place though my proper residence is in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001509">Trimble County </placeName>Kentucky, You may have forgotten me, but perhaps one of your Aids who I think is named <persName ref="cwgk:N00002641">Hughes </persName>may remember me as the man who when you first Entered upon the discharge of the duties of Your office, Came to Louisville to See you in reference to the acts and doings of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Rebells </orgName>in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001509">Trimble County </placeName>Kentucky, Since then Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> I have had to flee from that county to Save my life, and living in Madison as a means of Safety to myself and family (My only offence being that I was for my Government) but before I was forced to leave the County I was Set upon by the Rebells day after day my life threatened, my family kept in Continual Dread and alarm, untill I finally did not Know what to do, I was poor living upon a small farm, prominent among the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Rebells </orgName>who were persecuting me and threathning my life was, one <persName ref="cwgk:N00002642">Thomas Maddox </persName>his threats were of such a character, that at last I believed that if Maddox could he would take my life,<pb/>
<lb/>and in a moment of phrenzy being driven to almost craziness by the rebells, I Sent Maddox a note to fight him a duel rather than have my life Sacrificed without having no chance for it, but all was of no avail, I had to flee from the county with family to Save them and Myself, but as soon as I wrote the note the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Rebells </orgName>took advantage of it and got up an Indictment against me in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000581">Trimble Circuit Court </orgName>and on the <date when="1863-10-08">8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of this month</date> fined me five hundred Dollars, (without Even proving that the note was Ever delivered to Maddox) I was defended by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00000227">S.
