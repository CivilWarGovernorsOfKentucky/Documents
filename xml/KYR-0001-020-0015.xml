   <p>^To^ His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName> Govenor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky.</orgName> Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We the undersigned, citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002472">Caldwell County Ky</placeName> have long known <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Thomas B. Wadlington</persName>, to be a true hearted, good citizen, known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; his orderly &amp; peaceable conduct. The difficulty in which he was engaged with <persName ref="cwgk:N00011760">Milton A. Cartwright</persName>, did not appear to us, to be of his own seeking, nor are we satisfied nor do we believe that the case was fairly presented to the Jury as it actually occured. We hope your Excellency will review the case and give the poor man the benefit of every doubt &amp; we desire that his case may be Judged of in mercy &amp; regarded with favor. And that your Excellency will take into consideration evey circumstance, that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire that your Excellency may &amp; will be persuaded, that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency, and that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon or by a commutation of his punishment.</p>
