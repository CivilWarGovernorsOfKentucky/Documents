<p>And further would Show that the said Oakley in violation of sd Recognizance and the conditions thereof Ran away and absconded, Leaving the state of Kentucky and so concealing himself that neither the Sheriff or his said bail have been able since to find him or his whereabouts- or to make arrests and bring him into said court although they have made diligent Search and inquiry after him</p>
