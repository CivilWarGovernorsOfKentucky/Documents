   <p>To His Excellency<persName ref="cwgk:N00000258"> B Magoffin</persName> Governor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky.</orgName></p>
<p>Your Petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00002039">John D Mannen </persName>a Citizen of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky </placeName>and resident within the <placeName ref="cwgk:P001020">County of Warren</placeName> for the last Fifty four years, respectfully represents, that at the <date when="1859-05">May election 1859</date> he was duly &amp; legally elected a Justice of the Peace in and for the County of Warren and held, and to the best of his ability discharged the duties of his office until about the <date when="1861-03-30">30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March last.</date> That he was tendered &amp; accepted the office of Post Master at Graham, -- a <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>a country place, in his immediate vicenity. That he did this for the convenience of his neighbors, there being no person near who could so conveniently discharge its duties. In a pecuniary point of view the office was worthless, not more than one or two letters being received at it, on an average, per week. He accepted it, ignorant of the fact that there was any legal incompatability in his office of Justice of the Peace and that of Post Master under the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Federal Government</orgName> that the Post office at Graham was discontinued in <date when="1860-12">December last,</date> a short time after it was established and he no longer holds the position of Post Master there. Having learnd that the two offices of Justice of the Peace &amp; Post Master were incompatable, and that doubts are entertained as to the validity &amp; legality of any acst &amp; judgments he may do or render as a Justice<pb/>
<lb/>he has resigned that office. And now respectfully solicits &amp; prays Yr Excellency to re appoint him, to fill the vacancy thus occasioned during the remainder of the term for which he was elected ^or until the next general election^. There are from three to Four Hundred judgments in his office yet unsatisfied. and your Excy will at once percieve that his re appointment will be both a matter of great convenience to his district as well as of no small benefit to himself. All of which is most respectfully submitted by</p>
