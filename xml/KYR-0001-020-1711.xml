<lb/>His Excellency Governor Magoffin of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I was found guilty by the commonwealth Court of Lewis County for selling Liquor by the drink, my Licence only permitting the sale by quart. The fine put on me for this, was &#36;60<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> with Cost, In an address to your Exellency, I prayed for the remittance of this fine as I during of my trial was detained at home by sickness and not able to attend court personally, and your Excellency will have seen by the numerous signature of the petition, that this suit, against me was only an act of some personal enemies.</p>
<p>On this petition your Excellency granted me a respite of 6 months. Now in this hard time I am not able to raise this large amount or excecution shall soon taken place against me. Therefore I would pray most humbly that your Excellency may release me of<pb/>
<lb/>of this heavy fine or grant me a longer term of paiment.</p>
<p>I shall remain
<lb/>Your Excellency
