<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Gov. Magoffin</persName>
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir,</p>
<p>At the present Term of this <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000377">Court</orgName> an Indictment was found against <persName ref="cwgk:N00018762">Dennis Mulligan</persName> for Giving Liquor to a <persName ref="cwgk:N00018763">slave</persName> of <persName ref="cwgk:N00006296">O A Reynolds</persName>. I was present in the very town where the evidence was detailed. There was no proof of sale. Mulligan is a respectable grocer who does a large business, and I never heard him suspected of any thing of this sort before. He acknowledges that he gave the liquor to the slave, but says and I believe the statement that he intended no violation of the law. still it was a violation, and with the permission of the Court, he confessed Judgment for $50 -- As I know Mulligan, and do not think he intended to do wrong, I have thought proper at his request to say this much to your excellency with the hope that you will grant him remission</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00006117">W. S Downey</persName>
<lb/>Com atty</p>
<p>I concur in the above -- </p>
