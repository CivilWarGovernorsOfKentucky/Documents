   <p>To His Excellency <hi rend="str">H</hi> The <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor </persName>of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky</orgName> Your Petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00017575">Harvey Clark</persName> would most respectfully state that he was found guilty of manslaughter in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000425">Marion Circuit</orgName> at the <date when="1860-05">May Term of said Court 1860</date> and he was in Consequence thereof, sente^n^ced Confinement in the Jail and <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName> of this Commonwealth for the space of ten years -- </p>
<p>He states that he was much intoxicated at the time of said alleged manslaughter and the<persName ref="cwgk:N00017607"> man </persName>killed was also drinking. He was &amp; is poor, had no friends and had not been living <hi rend="str">as</hi> long in the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002413">County</placeName> when the aforesaid occurrence took place -- Says he has always been an industrious man but poor. He has been confined in the Penitentiary now since <date when="1860-06">June 1860</date> -- His family is very poor. He has a <persName ref="cwgk:N00017576">wife</persName> 4 daughters &amp; three sons one of which is so severly afflicted as to be unable to labour ^but^ verry little -- </p>
<p>Owing to the hardness of the times and the lack of demand for labor his children cannot get employment and are therefore hard run to make a living=</p>
<p>He has suffered greatly in body and mind <hi rend="str">since</hi> since he has been in the Penitentiary and he thinks the Keeper will say has served the State faithfully -- </p>
<p>He is pretty well advanced in life and has all the desire that a husband and father could have to be relieved from the prison and restored to his family=He is greatly wasted in flesh<pb/>
<lb/>and his hair is rapidly growing gray not so much from age as from the sorrows incident to his condition</p>
<p>If the punishment he has endured has been inflicted only to teach him to guard against vice and crime he is satisfied he has endured enough, to make him a temperate and discreet man the balance of his life and feels sure that if your Excellency will inquire of those who know what his conduct has been since he has been sentenced you will have reason to believe this declaration well grounded=</p>
<p>He prays your Excellency most sincerely to pardon his affense and remit the Judgment rendered against him and as in duty bound will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Harvey Clarke -- </p>
