<lb/>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin
</persName><lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In the case of the Comwlth vs <persName ref="cwgk:N00003281">Thomas Snyder</persName> in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName> his recognizance was forfeited at the <date when="1861-10">Octo</date> Term. <persName ref="cwgk:N00003282">Jno J Mason</persName> a non resident and evidently a well meaning man deposited with <persName ref="cwgk:N002040">R F Baird </persName>the amount of the bail, and Baird went upon the bond. Mason when Snyder did not appear, at considerable expense by a requisition from you had him brought here a day or so after the forfeiture. Snyder is now in jail and Baird refuses to give up the money because a Scire facias has been issued against. As the ends of justice will be attained in his production of the prisoner, Mason petitions your Excellency for a remission of the forfeiture</p>
<p>Resply 
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00001244">Lee Chambers
</persName><lb/>Deputy Clerk</p>
<p>PS. Mason states that he is not sure that a requisition was obtained. <persName ref="cwgk:N00003283">Judge Saffin</persName> of Cin arranged it for him<pb/></p>
<p>OK, <date when="1861-11-15">Nov <hi rend="underline">15</hi></date>
