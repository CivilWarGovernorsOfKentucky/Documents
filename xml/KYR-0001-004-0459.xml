<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>this letter will be handed to you by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hudgens, a lady of estimable character in her neighborhood. She has the misfortune to be the mother of a son now in the penitentiary for the crime of robbery. I was of counsil for Hudgens and was thrown in to considerable intercourse with him I found him a young man of intelligence &amp; learning He has evidently been well raised and his expressions of reprehension of his own crime was as vivid and I believe as genuine as a<hi rend="str">s</hi> contrite heart could suggest. He I learn is<pb/></p>
<p>the only son of this lady and has hitherto been her stay and support. I should not request his discharge on this ground but persuaded as I am that if now pardoned he would sin no more. I urge this as a strong persuasion.</p>
<p>Governor if you find your heart inclined to lean to the petition of <hi rend="str">your</hi> the <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> mother my belief is that the future conduct of the son will justify the exercise of your Kindness. I cannot say that he was not guilty but I do say that in my opinion he was operated upon by the influence of one<pb/>
<lb/>of the most wily rascals I have ever seen and in a moment of drunkeness went astray and was ruined.</p>
<p>I beg to recommend M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hudgens to your Kind consideration and bespeak for her a gentle hearing</p>
<p>Respt yours
<lb/><hi rend="underline">E J Bullock</hi></p>
