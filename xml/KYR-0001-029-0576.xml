   <p>To His Excellency Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Robinson</persName></p>
<p>The enclosed letter is from <hi rend="str">a</hi>the sons of an old Citizen who died in this County a few years since</p>
<p>I volunteered to defend him at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002296">Williamstown</placeName> &amp; finding he had been caught in bad company &amp; had offered to pass Counterfeit money I advised him to confess which he did</p>
<p>I was satisfied that a man who was in Company with him &amp; who had been acquitted was the real rascal but there was no means of proveing the fact -- The fellow was a shrewd sharp rascal &amp; had in my opinion put forward <persName ref="cwgk:N00002536">Herndon</persName> to pass the <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>Bank notes which he furnished him with</p>
<p>He has been pretty severely punished by the service rendered the state</p>
<p>I have an impression that I wrote out the facts which came out on the trial &amp; afterwards leading me to the belief of his haveng been a mere instrument in the hands of the others &amp; that the statement was filed in the Sec<hi rend="sup">tys</hi> office I cannot now recall the facts but will see about my Conclusion -- If consistent with the public good I would be glad<pb/>
<lb/>to see the poor being have a Chance for reformation</p>
<p>I well recollect at the trial that he was <hi rend="str">a</hi>in a miserable state of health from having been a hard drinker</p>
<p>Resply
