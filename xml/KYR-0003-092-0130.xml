<p>I have just examined the body of the late <persName ref="cwgk:N001002">Geo. W. Johnson</persName>, and can state in positive terms that I am able to identify the body beyond all doubt. I travelled to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001037">Virginia</placeName> with him last <date when="1861-08">August,</date> when he showed me the old injury to his left arm and hand; which I now perceive <unclear>unchanged</unclear>. I am also able to recognize the f<unclear/>.</p>
<p>He rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> two wounds: -- One in the right thigh, a flesh wound, and not mortal:- a second in the abdomen about half way between the navel and pubis a little to right of the median line. This last<pb/>
<lb/>wound was, beyond doubt, the cause of his death. He must have died very soon after receiving this last wound; probably from loss of blood, and with very little suffering.</p>
<p>Both of his wounds were rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in front and were apparently from mine balls.</p>

<p>Doctors, Bayliss &amp; Matthews- at my request, have been with me in this examination and I have no dificulty in recognising the remains of my friend.</p>
