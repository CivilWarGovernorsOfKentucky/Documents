(stealing a small perfume bag worth one Dollar) from a Drug store; your Petitioner was Induced to believe that the Young man, was not guilty of an Intentional Violation of the Law, but had taken the article more in a Joke or when on a Frolic, and being applied too by said Fricks who had but few acquaintances in the city, your Petitioner became the Security of said Fricks for his appearance in said court to answer said charge in the sum of $100: That said Fricks was Indicted by the Grand Jury ofsaid court and on the calling of said case for Trial said Fricks failed to appear having left &amp; gone to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001004">Nashville</placeName>, and a forfeiture was Entered &amp; Scifa issued and at the <date when="1863-12">December Term 1863</date> ofsaid city court a Judgement was rendered against your Petitioner for the sum of $100. with costs.
