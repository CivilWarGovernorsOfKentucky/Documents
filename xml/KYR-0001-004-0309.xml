<p>This is to certify that I was one of the Jury who tried the afsd Wm Schofield; I was about <placeName ref="cwgk:P00012270">Oakland</placeName> about the time the money was alledged to have been Stolen; I knew <persName ref="cwgk:N00012272">Weaver </persName>^he was a wagon master^ The man who lost the money, or Said he lost it. I heard Weaver tell about it frequently; and he never heard him tell the Same Story twice; he was So frequently drunk; and he told so many different tales about it; and he had around him Such a bad <unclear>Set</unclear> a men; that I was led to beleave that it was uncertain whether he lost it atall; or if he did he, I am Satisfied knew nothing aboot who got it. I was on the Jury and was greatly Surprized that Schofield plead guilty; but having plead guilty we could not do any thing else but find him So. I Sign the petition with <hi rend="str">pleasure</hi> <hi rend="str">and</hi> earnestly ask your executive clemency..</p>
