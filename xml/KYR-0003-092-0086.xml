<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>While you were so constantly occupied last fall in fulfilling your political engagements I thought it best not to trouble you with those of a pecuniary character, and even now I name them with great reluctance -- </p>
   <p>Since you conversed with me on the subject of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00008367">Palmer</persName> matter I have had two letters from him -- One of regret in not being able to pay his annual interest and expressing his determination to sell his place and pay his debts -- The other is in reply to my enquiries in regard to the condition on which you said you agreed to sign the note with <persName ref="cwgk:N00008275">M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hanly</persName> -- He does<pb/>
<lb/>not seem to recollect exactly what conversation took place between you when he asked for your name, except that he told you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H was a man of property and that you should not suffer -- He says that his property at a low calculation is worth &#36;50.000, &#36;10.000 in negroes, &#36;5000 in Stock and 8000 acres of land -- He owes &#36;10.000 -- </p>
<p>He adds "To releive M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Johnsons mind I am willing to give him a deed of trust on any or all of my property, for he shall never suffer" -- I give you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. P<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> statements and leave you to act in the case as you think proper -- -- I have never seen M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hanly but once, since I conversed with you on the subject of the securityship, and then he was engaged with ladies which prevented me from approaching him</p>
   <p>The other case -- <persName ref="cwgk:N00003257">Dick Allen</persName>, is, I suppose a hopeless case -- I do not care about the principal at present, but the interest due would be acceptable -- <pb/></p>
<p>It is a fact I have been living on borrowed money for five months past, not having received one cent either of principal or interest due me -- </p>
<p>Sometime when you are in town please call in and w<hi rend="str">a</hi>e will talk about our troubles -- </p>
   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008274">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hawkins</persName> had not heard anything from <persName ref="cwgk:N00008273"><unclear>Neat</unclear></persName> yesterday -- I think he will see such gloomy times in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002303">N. O</placeName> as will induce him to hurry back-</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
 <lb/><hi rend="underline"><persName ref="cwgk:N00008276">Leonard Wheeler</persName></hi><pb/></p>
