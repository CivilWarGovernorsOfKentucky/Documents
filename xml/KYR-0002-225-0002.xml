<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00002747">Phil Swigert</persName> Esqr<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>We have ^had^ a <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000902">home Guard</orgName> organized at this place for about 6 weeks. We have made an attempt to procure arms from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Genl Goverment</orgName>. but have as yet failed most of our men are poor but first rate &amp; these hard times many of them cannot raise means to pay for their uniform &amp; Gun both, as the freights &amp;C on the Guns from the Goverment will cost $1.50 each. we have money to pay for uniform &amp; music. I wish to know if we cannot get Guns from the State. If we organize according to the late law in regard to Home Guards -- There was 100 Guns I think Given to<persName ref="cwgk:N00000859"> Genl Johnson</persName><hi rend="sup">s</hi> secession Co of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000869">Montgomery Co</placeName>. He never paraded more than 25 or 30 men I understand that Company is about to disband It was raised under a secession flag. What chance would there be to get 50 of those Guns -- or some from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>. There is a company at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001940">Stanton</placeName> 4 <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">2</hi> miles from me that want guns. Home Guards good men -- If we could get Johnson<hi rend="sup">s</hi> guns would do for both companies. The company at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001940">Stanton</placeName> I wrote you about several days since marched last Saturday under a secession flag -- <pb/></p>
<p>There has been in the last 3 or 4 days considerable stir amongst the secessionst in this neighborhood. on last Saturday two of them 1 from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000514">Paris</placeName>. <persName ref="cwgk:N001001">R Haw</persName><hi rend="sup">s</hi> son &amp; a man by the name of <persName ref="cwgk:N00008511">Cole</persName> from <placeName ref="cwgk:P001792">Winchester</placeName> arrived in the neighborhood at 12 oclock at night &amp; next morning early had conference with some Secessiont &amp; returned Sunday morning. I have had some hints, that they expected to make an attack upon the arms in case any should be attempted to be carried through Ky for East <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tennessee</placeName></p>
   <p>I have a Son <persName ref="cwgk:N00008506">Geo M Jackson</persName> of Winchester. late Editor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00008504">National Union</orgName>, a paper published in that town who is now engaged in raising a company to Join <persName ref="cwgk:N00002299">Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00002299">Rousus</persName></persName> Regiment near <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> or to go to Cumberland Gap if necessary. he has only been at it a week &amp; has about 50 No 1 men &amp; think he will make it from 80 to 100 this week. If not too busy will you please write me. I feel some interest to know where we are to get Guns. we have ^some^ desperate secessionist in our neighborhood &amp; may have to use the guns at home</p>
