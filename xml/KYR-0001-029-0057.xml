<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I do not wish to intrude myself upon your labors in <orgName ref="cwgk:O00008002">Frankfort</orgName>, but at the instance of several members of the Bar and the urgent appeals of <persName ref="cwgk:N00017346">Mrs. Hedges</persName> &amp; her son I write you a line in regard to the <persName ref="cwgk:N00017345">old man</persName> now in our <orgName ref="cwgk:O00014862">jail</orgName> here suffering out his fine of $188; He is very poor, without a dollar in money: his two sons have both volunteered in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">army</orgName> &amp; his services are absolutely necessary to the Comfort of his family=the first man will swear that Hedges did not want the house burned -- be this as it may Hedges I understand is absolutely required at home He was in jail 2 months before trial and 25 days since. His wife comes to the jail every day or so and is very much distressed <persName ref="cwgk:N00017353">Uncle Buck</persName> said to me to day that he would rather pay something himself rather than not have him out -- Winter is coming on &amp; his wife says if he can get out, they will try &amp; make arrangements to live during the winter -- what crop he has needs attention &amp; saving -- I would not urge this upon you did I not think it humanity to do so -- I know you will do what you think right &amp; it is not necessary for me to say <pb/>
<lb/>anything more -- a representation from you to <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor Robinson</persName> will be all that is necessary to obtain his pardon &amp; I sincerely hope it may seem good to you to exercise your influence with the Governor -- it is only for the sake of his wife &amp; the comfort of his family during the coming winter that I write to you this appeal. No news here -- the town is alive on <persName ref="cwgk:N00000826">Wadsworth</persName> Garnisher, tax questions -- generally against him -- </p>
<p>Yours very truly
