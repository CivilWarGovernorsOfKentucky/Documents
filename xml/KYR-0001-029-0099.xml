<p>Sir! The subscriber your petitioner would respectfully state, that her husband <persName ref="cwgk:N00017569">John Ey</persName>, got in a difficulty with <persName ref="cwgk:N00017572">somebody</persName> who lived in the same house with him, when he was arrested and fined forty dollars &amp; costs, for which he had to give Security, now your petitioner would state that her husband has been these last 12 months in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">U. S. Service</orgName>, also his <persName ref="cwgk:N00017573">Brother</persName> is in service and the Officers of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001838">City Court</orgName> are very clamorous to collect the fine, your petitioner is very poor and not able to pay the fine at this time, and (should she be compelled) that the Security has to pay the above sum, her husband is bound to pay the same back, and that will take 3 months wages. There is now some $25<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> Cost to pay, she your petitioner is willing to pay that, if your Exellency will have the Kindness to remit the fine, and your petitioner flatters herself that you will grand her request.</p>
