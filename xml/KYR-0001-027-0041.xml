<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Jas. F. Robinson</persName>. <lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville, Ky</placeName>.<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi></p>
<p>Since receiving y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> appointment as commander of "the Home forces in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000446">mason</placeName>" I have done what I could to provide for the defence of this part of the state. Being without arms, amunition &amp; everything else needful, I could do but little against an enemy numerous &amp; active, &amp; well mounted, able to advance quickly &amp; retreat faster than I could pursue.</p>
<p>My only organized means of defense, consisted of a fragment of the 14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav., dismounted recruits, some fugitives from the invaders (about 70) partly mounted, 60 of the 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky, Cav, &amp; my ^city^ <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000902">Home Guards</orgName>. The recruits for the 14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav, amounted to nearly 700 men at M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Sterling, but retreating from that point after the battle of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00009682">Richmond</placeName> on foot, &amp; <hi rend="str">mainly</hi> mostly unamed, they arrived here about 300 strong- some without coats, some without shoes, &amp; none either armed or clothed by the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">state</orgName> or Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> -I sent them into Camp at the expense of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">state</orgName>, with the straggling fugitives from the 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav. &amp; about 70 men formed into a <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000916">militia </orgName>company as <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">state</orgName> troops under Capt<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">n</hi></hi> Mitchell.</p>
<p>Wednesday night last, the enemy 800 strong, under <persName ref="cwgk:N00009694">Gano</persName>, occupied <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003325">Mayslick</placeName>, 12 miles from here. From the misconduct of one of my own officers, I only learned the fact at 3 o'clk a.m.<pb/>
<lb/>thursday. I made my dispositions either to fight or cross the river, as I might think best; intending to adopt the latter course, if the enemy advanced in force. After day light I proceeded with the mounted men, numbering about 100 (including 60 of the 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav.) to reco<hi rend="str">m</hi>noitre on the <placeName ref="cwgk:P001002">Lexington</placeName> road. The 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky, Cav. with their consistent cowardice &amp; insubordination, refused to march, or obey my orders, but <hi rend="str">broke &amp;</hi> deserted &amp; forced their way on the Ferry boat &amp; crossed to Aberdeen ^O.^ With the remainder I went as far as <placeName ref="cwgk:P00009689">Washington</placeName>, The enemy soon made his appearance &amp; drove in my pickets, capturing three -- the rest rallied on the support I had brought. I at once fell back slowly &amp; in order to Maysville &amp; crossed over my whole Command &amp; all its small property, without haste or confusion. The enemy sent in a flag of truce, shortly after to the <persName ref="cwgk:N00008307">Mayor of Maysville</persName> demanding its surrender. The mayor replied that he had no means of resistence.</p>
<p>The <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">rebels</orgName> never occupied the town or hoisted their flag. The main body remained at Washington 'till sundown &amp; then, learning that <hi rend="str">we</hi>I had joined with some of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009693">Ohio militia</orgName>, &amp; was attempting to surround them by a movement across the <geogName ref="cwgk:G001825">Ohio river</geogName> at Logans' Gap, they fell back to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00009688">Lewisburgh</placeName> &amp; next morning retreated from Mason County. They continued to fall back through <placeName ref="cwgk:P00009690">Millersburg</placeName> to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000514">Paris</placeName> -- there about 300 under the rebel <persName ref="cwgk:N00009698">Cameron</persName> left Gano &amp; proceeded to M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Sterling where they are now encamped &amp; recruiting. Gano we hear went to Lexington.<pb/></p>
<p>Since my return to this city, I have examined the roads by a small force for some miles, &amp; have accurate news of the enemy as far as <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002306">owingsville</placeName>, M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Sterling &amp; Paris. There is no enemy that I cannot take care of, this side of those points.</p>
<p>We hear that <persName ref="cwgk:N00000845">Humphrey Marshall</persName> is Coming through the mountains. we have heard it for 10 days, &amp; have ceased to credit it, but have taken means to know all about his movements.</p>
<p>I desire authority to buy or press 500 horses &amp; two wag<hi rend="str">g</hi>ons, for the purpose of mounting that many men of the 14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav. now in my Camp, <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> that soon will be. If I am permitted to do so, I will go to Owingsville &amp; M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Sterling &amp; break up the rebel camp, thereabouts, protect &amp; rally the people there. I have a light six pounder (iron) but wish one or two mountain Howitzer's still lighter, -- I want fixed ammunition for my gun. I have nothing. The Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> wholly neglects us: of all the regiments raised in our part of the state, not one <hi rend="str">ram</hi> remains to help us -- Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Wright took away the last (the 10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav.) &amp; left us naked to our enemies.</p>
<p>If I can get permission to press the horses, I have the men <hi rend="str">&amp;</hi> guns &amp; equipments- but will need ammunition. 500 mounted men, with a section of light artillery will run the rebels &amp; their recruits out of my District or destroy them.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00009692">Judge Bush</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001786">Clarke</placeName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00003127">R. Apperson jr</persName>, Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Dick<pb/>
<lb/>Williams, <persName ref="cwgk:N00003130">Van B. Young</persName>, &amp; other gentlemen are here with me<hi rend="str">n</hi>, &amp; have been the greatest comfort &amp; support in my troubles. They will help me drive the rebel marauders from their homes should you furnish us the horses. The affair requires speed.</p>
<p>Very truly
