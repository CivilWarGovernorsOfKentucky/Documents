<lb/>To his Excellency 
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">James F Roberson</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am informed that <persName ref="cwgk:N00014212">John H. Stevens</persName> of this County, who was formerly a magistrate <hi rend="str">of this</hi>, has re^s^igned his office and that his resignation has been forwarded to you, <persName ref="cwgk:N00016256">John N Shoubart</persName> of this County desires the appointment in the place of John H Stevens. I think he is well qualified for the office, a clever man, and would give general satisfaction if he was appointed. I have been presiding Judge of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00011050">county court</orgName> of this county for the last four years and know pretty well who will suit the people, he is a union man and his loyalty, as far as I know, has never been questioned &amp;c</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00014423">James H. French</persName> P J M C C<pb/></p>
<p>For appt. of Justice</p>
