   <p>To His Excellency. <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName> Govenor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Ky</orgName>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- We the citizens of the town of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002273">Princeton</placeName> and acquaintances of <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Thomas B. Wadlington</persName> who was convicted of the crime of murder, and sentenced to be hung, at the last term of our <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000363">Caldwell Circuit Court</orgName>, respectfully and earnestly solicit your Excellency, that you may and will interpose your Executive clemency in his behalf, and that he be <hi rend="underline">pardoned</hi>. We will now represent unto your Excellency, a few of those reasons, which have induced us to make this appeal in his behalf.</p>
<p>Thomas B. Wadlington was born, and raised in our midst, and is now about fifty years of age -- and from childhood, up to the time of this difficulty has been a peaceable, quiet, industrious and worthy citizen of our community -- </p>
<p>Whether we consider him as a husband, father, neighbor -- citizen, or an industrious Tiller of the soil, he stood without reproach, and he had our respect -- By a jury of his country he has been found guilty of murder, and such finding has ^been^ upon an appeal, pronounced to be in accordance with the Law.</p>
<p>His son, was also, jointly indicted with him &amp; was found guilty of manslaughter, and is now confined in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName> for the same offence. -- Up to this time, that son -- a youth, was esteemed<pb/>
<lb/>by his neighbors &amp; friends &amp; the community in which he lived, for his industrious habits, &amp; his moral standing and character, he being a consistent member of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00013979">Cumberland Presbyterian Church</orgName> -- And the remarkable fact is presented to your Excellency, of two citizens of such established character being presented before you, in the position of criminals condemned for murder and manslaughter. The statement of <persName ref="cwgk:N00011765">William J. Wadlington</persName>, son of Thomas B. Wadlington, is so totally different from that of the witnesses in behalf of the Commonwealth. (namely, <persName ref="cwgk:N00013981">Prince</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00013982">Blaylock</persName>.) upon whose testimony the aforesaid parties have been convicted and are so entirely consistent with the circumstances of the case, as shown by other witnesses, that it has impressed us strongly with the belief that our neighbor &amp; fellow citizen, under the rules of the <hi rend="underline">rigid</hi> <hi rend="underline">law</hi> <hi rend="underline">has</hi> <hi rend="underline">been</hi> <hi rend="underline">badly</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">hardly</hi> dealt with, and that in fact &amp; truth he is no murderer. The statements of the son William are clear and positive that <persName ref="cwgk:N00011760">Milton A. Cartwright</persName>, the D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">ecd</hi></hi>, shot <hi rend="underline">first</hi>, and if under the rules of our law, his statement had been admitted, it appears to us that the transaction would have appeared <hi rend="str">to</hi> <hi rend="str">us</hi> in the light of a case of Self Defence. But if under and by Law the statements of the<pb/>
<lb/>youth &amp; Son, was rightfully or wrongfully excluded from the jury, in Thomas B. Wadlington's trial, yet we do think that it should come before your Excellency, and that freemen should have the right at least, to proclaim to you their wrongs, and appeal to you to redress them. The statements of the parties have been totally excluded from the consideration of the court or jury -- With this petition, you will see the statement of the unfortunate young man, as also his father's statement, made in open court, at the time of the sentence of judgement, and also the record containing the statement of the witnesses, now on file in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000311">office of the Court of Appeals</orgName>. What a conflict and how irreconsilable!</p>
<p>Let us appeal to your Excellency in behalf of the doubt, which such a conflict of statements of facts presents -- May that character which the poor man has borne for fifty years, appeal to you in his behalf. May the gray haired and honored sire, may the broken hearted <persName ref="cwgk:N00011763">wife</persName> and his three little children, through us appeal to your Excellency to <hi rend="underline">restore</hi> <hi rend="underline">him</hi> <hi rend="underline">to</hi> <hi rend="underline">life</hi>, to <hi rend="underline">liberty</hi>, to the protection of the <hi rend="underline">Hearth</hi> <hi rend="underline">Stone</hi> and that the bitter cup might be spared them, and the unfortunate accused. But should this by your<pb/>
<lb/>Excellency be deemed unadvisable, (which God forbid) may we be still allowed to ask and entreat that the life of the unfortunate man may be spared, and that his sentence be commuted;</p>
