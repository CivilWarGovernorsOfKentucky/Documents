   <p>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">B. Magoffin</persName>
<lb/>Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>Your Excellency has heretofore, we understand had your attention called to the pardon of <persName ref="cwgk:N00010747">William Brookover</persName>, &amp; we deem it unnecessary to say any thing in regard to the facts of the case, &amp; will only refer you to the record of the case on file in the Clerk's office of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000311">Court of Appeals</orgName> at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>, We beleive that this case is one calling for the exercise of executive clemancy, &amp; that you will agree with us, when you examine into the case as developed in this record -- </p>
<p>Brookover has been prosecuted with unrelenting fury &amp; rancor, No one can be injured by his pardon, The public will sustain no wrong thereby -- His <persName ref="cwgk:N00010761">wife</persName>, who is a worthy woman, &amp; who seems devotedly attached to him, will have a mountain weight removed from her mind.</p>
<p>We would suggest that the par-<pb/>
<lb/>don may be conditional, &amp; void upon his return to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>.</p>
<p>We believe this is a strong case for the exercise of clemency -- and mercy, &amp; hope it may accord with your views to grant the pardon as above indicated</p>

<p><milestone unit="column" n="1"/>I am well acquainted with Brookover &amp; have had a great many dealings with him, before this transaction for which he was indicted &amp; found guilty &amp; I have always found him honest &amp; correct. Public opinion seemed to be against him in this trial, he was prosecuted with an unrelenting fury, &amp; great pains taken to poison the public mind against ^him^ but I have every reason to believe him innocent ^or great doubt, in regard to his guilt^ &amp; that your Excellency ought to pardon him, if not for his own sake for the sake of his wife, who is a truly<pb/> 
<lb/>worthy woman, &amp; for the sake of his children</p>
