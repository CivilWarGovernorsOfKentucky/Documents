   <p>XXX Direct your letter George to me ^here^ and inclose it in an Envelope and that in another Envelope and direct that to <persName ref="cwgk:N00001226">George W -- Norton</persName> at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002479">Russelville Ky</placeName> -- Care of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00008166">the Commerical Bank at Paducah</orgName>"</p>
<p><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000560">Bowling Green Ky</placeName><lb/><date when="1861-12-16">Dec 16. 1861</date>.
<lb/>My Dear <persName ref="cwgk:N00008172">Ann</persName></p>
<p>I have not written to you for some time and have dispaired of hearing from you at all. I know that you have written often, as I have to you, but I presume my letters to you are intercepted and detained as I presume yours are to me. I now hope that this may reach you, as I send this by means which hope will be successfull You must continue to make efforts to get a letter to me, as one may reach me at last; and I would prize it more than any thing else on earth. No letter or direct information from any of you, has ever reached me since I left home in September.</p>
<p>I am now here, in good health, and <persName ref="cwgk:N00008176">Matty</persName> is with <persName ref="cwgk:N00004777">Capt Morgan</persName> a few miles out of the Town. The power which has been placed in my hands, by the People here, I intend to use for the benefit of the People in every part of the State, and of every party. so far as that is possible in consistence with a fixed and un<hi rend="str">l</hi>alterable determination for it to remain in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.<pb/>
<lb/>In other words, I intend to adhere till death to the position taken, by our People, no private Citizen shall be able to say truly that I have injured him. Of cource you know that our State is admitted into the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Southern Confederacy</orgName> and our Deputies elected to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00008174">Richmond</placeName> Else I would not state it in this letter, for it the condition under which I am now writing to you, to state nothing of a political or military character.</p>
   <p>Matty had a severe attack of measles several weeks ago, but I took up to <persName ref="cwgk:N00002592">Gen Buckners</persName> head quarters, where I then messed, and he was well taken care of and has entirely recovered -- Since his recovery he has been on two Scouting Expeditions, beyond <geogName ref="cwgk:G00003748">Green river</geogName> and <unclear>reported</unclear> to burn the bridge over Bacon Creek under the noses of the enemy. Morgan is an excellent Officer, much talked of here intelligent, active daring and prudent also. He thinks a great deal of Matty and is very kind to him -- The character of his service is very dangerous, but I trust that God will protect our son.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008189">George Ward</persName> is now here from Lake Washington, to see <persName ref="cwgk:N00008191">Junius</persName> who is much better than he has been. and does service every day. I saw Breckridge however -- on <pb/>
<lb/>yesterday, who thinks it best to give Junius a furlough for a short time, and I concur fully with him. He will probably start tomorrow for the South.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008193">John Viley</persName> is also very well. He and Matty and <persName ref="cwgk:N00008188">Lewis Payne</persName>, have grown very much. Matty's Uniform cant be worn by him. There are all in the finest health now, freezing for a fight. which may be very near or very distant -- it being impossible to tell any thing about it. </p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008187">Remus Paynes</persName>' sons are all well. <persName ref="cwgk:N001789">John Breckenridge</persName> told me to say, that he had said to all of them, that when they were sick they must at once report to him- He himself has had a very severe attack of Jaundice, but is now, I consider, well His eyes are no longer yellow and he looks very well indeed</p>
<p>How often do I think of you, my dear wife; and of you, my children, may God in his infinite mercy, bless you and protect better than I have been able to do. I have no heart, to think of my home except in connection with you. You must manage every thing as you please. Give my love to <hi rend="underline">all</hi> our friends. I do not name them because I have not Space-</p>
<p>Your Husband
