<p>Attest Joel Sweeney Clk C C C</p>
<p>His Excellency Tho E Bramlette Governor of Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Martin Thomas Sen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> most respectfully represents that the Grand Jury for Casey County Ky found an Indictment against one "<hi rend="underline">Morning</hi> <hi rend="underline">Thomas</hi>," for standing &amp; <unclear>stalling</unclear> to Mares his Stud horse without first having obtained a Licence, the Summon executed on your petitioner as being the person indicted and at the <date when="1864-05">May term 1864</date> of the Casey Circuit Court Judgement was rendered on said Indictment for Nineteen Dollars fine &amp; costs by Default upon said Judgement an execution issued &amp; is now in the hands of the sheriff of Casey County for Collection <hi rend="str">and</hi> who has demanded of me payment on the ground I suppose that I have ^or had^ an old Stud horse (of the Thomas family) in Casey County at the ^time the^ Indictment was made (<date when="1863-05">May term 1863</date>) there being no other Thomas having a stud Horse the initials of whose name agrees as well with the person indicted as Mine, I am being identified as the Thomas who was indicted and it may be true the jurors struck at me and failed to give my true &amp; full name: (I know of no Thomas whose name is Morning in the County)<pb/>
<lb/>In consequence of ill health of myself &amp; Family and my <unclear>fee</unclear>bleness of body I made no defence to the indictment <hi rend="str">&amp;</hi> knowing myself innocent of the offence charged I could not believe any man living could or would make good the charge- as before said, I had a stud Horse about 20 Years of age used by me as a work beast on my Farm and in the Spring of the year <date when="1863">1863</date>. some of my friends &amp; neighbours petitioned me to let him to their Mares which I did demanding no price nor receiving any pay for said horses Services, doing it to gratify the fancy ^&amp; whim^ of My neighbour &amp; friends- the foregoing statements are true Now to quiet further proceedings in this Matter whether I am held up as the offender or not, <hi rend="str">t</hi>the promises considered <hi rend="str">you</hi> I ask at your hands, should my cause merit it; an entire remission of the fine aforesaid or <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> such <hi rend="str">all</hi> relief as you in your clemency may think <unclear>proper</unclear> to grant. will be thankfully received by your friend and Humble Servant.</p>
