<lb/>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">B. Magoffin</persName><lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have just read your instructions, to the Judges of the County Courts of Kentucky, requiring the return to the State Arsenal- of all arms &amp;c, belonging to the State not now in the hands of lawfully organized Military Companies,</p>
<p>I have in my possession one hundred Muskets which were some time since placed in my care- to be held subject to your order -- by <persName ref="cwgk:N00005365">Capt. H. B. Lyon</persName>, his <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000916">Company of State Volunteers</orgName> having disbanded</p>
<p>Now as I have no way of sending these muskets to the State Arsenal except by the <geogName ref="cwgk:G001825">Ohio River</geogName>, or by the <geogName ref="cwgk:G00006218">Cumberland River</geogName> to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002783">Clarksville Ten</placeName>, thence by Rail Road, and fearing they would be Seized at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000393">Evansville</placeName> or Clarksville, I deem it most prudent not to ship them until I have further instructions from you,</p>
<p>After Capt Lyon's Company disbanded <persName ref="cwgk:N00007245">Mr. R W Wake</persName> of this place raised a Company of eighty men (which can readily be increased to 100) to be mustered<pb/>
<lb/>into the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000303">State Guards</orgName> as Soon as an Assistant Inspector Should be appointed when application would be made to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00006066">Military Board</orgName> for the arms now in my possession, <persName ref="cwgk:N00000832">Col. W. B. Machen</persName> informes me that he wrote you Some two weeks ^since^ Suggesting the Appointment of Mr. R. W. Wake Asst. Inspector but has received no reply, I would also recommend said appointment</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00006362">F. H. Skinner</persName><lb/>Presiding Judge <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000647">Lyon County Court</orgName><pb/></p>

<p>Arms -- Refer to Board.</p>
