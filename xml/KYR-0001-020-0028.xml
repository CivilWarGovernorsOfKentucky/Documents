   <p>To his Excellency<persName ref="cwgk:N00000258"> Bariah Maggoffin </persName>Govornor of The <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth of Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002472">Caldwell County</placeName> have long known <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Thomas. B. Wadlington</persName> and he has ever been considered a good and true harted citizen and noted for his industry and good and orderly conduct The difficulty in which he was engaged with <persName ref="cwgk:N00011760">Milton A Cartwright</persName> did not appear to us, to be of his seeking. Nor are we satisfied that the case was presented to the Jury as it really occurred, We hope your Excellency will review the case, and give the poor man the benefit of every doubt We desire that his case may be Judged in mercy and regarded with favor and that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf and we desire that your Excellency may and will be persuaded that it is consistant with your duty to extend to him Executive clemency and that his life may be spared either by a full pardon or by a commutation of his punishment. Yours respectfully
