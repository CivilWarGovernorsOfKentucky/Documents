   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Govenor Bramlette</persName> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent to your Excellency that in <date when="1862-05">May 1862</date> <persName ref="cwgk:N00006351">William Halsell</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00006349">James Halsell</persName> James M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Cormick <persName ref="cwgk:N00001574">John S Jones</persName> <hi rend="str">and</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00002338">James Jones</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00001575">John W Grubb</persName> entered into a Bail Bond before <persName ref="cwgk:N00001579">P Hines</persName> Police Judge of the Town of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000560">Bowling-Green Ky</placeName> (he having held an examining Court) for the appearance of <persName ref="cwgk:N00001571">Jessee McCormick</persName> in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000585">Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court</orgName> at the <date when="--02">February</date> Term of ^s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> court^ next succeeding said Examining Court said McCormick was charged with Grand Larceny, the said <persName ref="cwgk:N00001571">Jessee McCormick</persName> failed to appear <hi rend="str">at</hi> at said Court in pursuance <hi rend="str">said</hi> of said Bond, and the Commonwealth took a forfeiture of said Bond for the sum of Four hundred dollars which was the amount of the Bail fixed by said Police Judge,</p>
<p>Your petitioners would further represent to your Excellency that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Jessee McCormick was a young man Just grown to manhood and ^was^ easily alarmed &amp; was influenced by some evil disposed persons to leave the Country and not stand his trial. They would further represent, that all the parties above mentioned against whom said forfeiture was taken, are poor men with Families to support, except William<pb/>
<lb/>Halsell who is in moderately good circumstances, to pay said amount of four hundred dollars would be very oppressive upon them. Your Excellency gave a respite some time since of Twelve months which time has nearly elapsed They would feel under lasting obligations if your Excellency would relieve them altogether from the payment of said sum of Four hundred Dollars,</p>
