<lb/>Sir.</p>
   <p>By the same mail which brings you this letter, I have written to His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor Bramlette</persName>, in reference to the General Orders issued for the raising of a military force &amp;c. I am glad to see this done: and shall be happy to do what I can to promote the object intended to be effected-- This measure ought to have been long since adopted, in as much as it will tend, more than anything else towards quieting this most distracted part of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>. If within the compass of my ability to aid His Excellency. I can be of any service, I will accept any appointment for which I may be designated-- My references are <persName ref="cwgk:N00000881">Genl Combs</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00000882">Col Bolling</persName>-- <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000885">Messrs. Harlan</orgName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00000884">James J Miller Esq.</persName>. and my correspondence on file with <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Gov. Robinson</persName>, in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000890">State Department</orgName>.</p>
<p>It seems to me however, that the time ought to be extended by a Special Order for the raising of at least two Companies of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000303">State Guard</orgName> in this Co. for some thirty days-- in as much as owing to the difficulties in the way of mails, the two General Orders were only received this morning as the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000891">Clk</persName><pb/>
<lb/>of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000624">County Court</orgName> informs me. Can this be done? I see no good reason why it may not, by a special order to date from the appointment of a Colonel &amp; Lieut Col. Throwing myself out of the question-- I would respectfully recommend W Frs Bucknor and <persName ref="cwgk:N00000886">G. M. Wilburn</persName> as competent men. bo<hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>th are loyal, honest and tried men-- and will do their duty.</p>
<p>Kentucky must be defended by Kentuckians and her integrity maintained at all hazards. Whatever we have to complain of, must deferred until the most stupendous rebellion the world has ever known is crushed out.</p>
<p>With great respect
<lb/>Your Obt Sevrt
