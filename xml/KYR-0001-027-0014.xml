<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00001049">Col. J H Garrard
</persName><lb/>Dr Sir,</p>
<p>I send back the Box containing the watches as I find that there is no possibility of delivering them soon -- please hand the Carpet Sack to <persName ref="cwgk:N00009386">Mr. Crutcher</persName> at the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000203">Capital Hotel </orgName>-- </p>
<p>I have very bad news to write- though I expect you have heard, ere this by telegraph I conversed with <persName ref="cwgk:N00009380">Mr Johnson</persName> of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009378">Mundys Cavalry</orgName> this evening and learned that. himself and some six of that Cavalry were out scouting near <placeName ref="cwgk:P00009385">Big Creek Gap</placeName>. when they were surprised and pursued by some 500 of<pb/>
<lb/>the enemy Cavalry who pursued them some distance Johnson and his Comrades made their way towards <placeName ref="cwgk:P00005368">Barboursville</placeName> and on the road whi<hi rend="str">sl</hi>lst concealed they saw 5000 Infantry &amp; Cavalry pass -- and also learned from Some refugee citizens from that place. that the town was then occupied with about 6000 more,</p>
   <p>I also learned that the enemy, are in force at<placeName ref="cwgk:P00000907"> Mt Vernon</placeName>. Some 1500 -- strong with three pieces of Artilery and here <persName ref="cwgk:N00003011">Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Smith</persName> is at this place. with Some 650 Cavalry with about 50 Carbines, you Can imagine how he feels there is no disguising the fact. that <persName ref="cwgk:N00009384">Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Morgan's</persName><pb/>
<lb/>is in a very dangerous fix, with all of his provisions cut-off- a large force threatening him in front -- and some. 8000 in his rear, I tremble for the result -- the above news we have from undoubted authority,</p>
<p>what are we to do why dont the authorities send reinforcements, but I fear it is now to late</p>
<p>try and do something to help us:</p>
<p>Yours truly
