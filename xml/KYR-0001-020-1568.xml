   <p>His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName>,<lb/>Governor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State of Kentucky</orgName>:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00004013">George Presing</persName> states that about the <date when="1861-12-01">first December 1861</date> he was attending to his business, at his own home, in the city of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001002">Lexington</placeName>, when one <persName ref="cwgk:N00004014">John Matter</persName> came into his house. Matter, as the Proof in the case showed, was drinking and soon became noisy and Your Petitioner ordered him out of his house. Matter refused to go and your petitioner took him by the collar and attempted to eject him from his premises, when Matter getting the best of him, and forcing him to the wall Your Petitioner obtained a knife, and not wishing to kill his antagonist, cut Matter in the leg- Matter received no scratch elsewhere- Your Petitioner was arraigned before the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000729">Lexington City Court </orgName>and fined by a majority of the jury in the sum of $40<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> Some of the jury were for one cent fine, others for discharging the prisoner -- Petitioner has paid into the City Court, on said fine, $25<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">05</hi></hi> -- which, however, is<pb/>
<lb/>merely the Marshall and clerks costs and Attorneys percentum -- Your Petitioner would state to his Excellency that he was merely defending his own home and premises, and had the case been properly understood by the jury he does not believe he would have been fined one cent -- Your petitioner would ever feel grateful to his Excellency to remove the remainder of the Forty dollar fine which now amounts only to Twenty Eight dollars
