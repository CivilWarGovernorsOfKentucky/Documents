   <p>To His Excellency The Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your memorialist Adam Beuther a citizen of Louisville would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1860-03">March Term 1860</date> of the City Court of Louisville he was fined the sum of Fifty Dollars and cost for an alledged assault made upon one Protas Nutto -- The case had been continued on the Docket until the cost amounted to Nine <hi rend="sup">40</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> Dollars exclusive of the Attorneys portion of the fine -- The party assaulted is a member of a cabinet maker Society with your Petitioner, who provoked the assault and was not seriously hurt, only receiving a slight scratch on the hand -- Your Petitioner represents further that he viewed the matter in so trivial a light that he did not attend to the case and moreover paid to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Nutto Eight Dollars and a half for the injury he sustained and made friends with him -- The fine is an exorbitant one, so much so that it will be oppressive to your Petitioner to pay the same, as he is poor and a man of family, and a working Mechanic<pb/>
<lb/>and the vindication of the law does not call for oppression upon the citizen.</p>
<p>In view of all the facts in this case he respectfully prays a remission of that portion of said fine belonging to the Commonwealth. He has with great inconvenience to himself and family paid all the cost in the case</p>
<p>And will ever pray &amp;c
<lb/>A Beuther</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully recommend that ^the^ prayer of the foregoing Petition be granted, believing that the case is a meritorious one -- </p>
