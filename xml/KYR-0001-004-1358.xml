   <p>To his Excellency Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlette</persName> -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners represent that they were jurors in the case of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName> against <persName ref="cwgk:N00004883">John Patterson</persName> tried at the <date when="1864-11">November Term 1864</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000424">Mercer Circuit Court</orgName> on a charge of maliciously shooting &amp; wounding <persName ref="cwgk:N00002275">A G Kyle</persName> and as such under the instructions of the Court they gave &amp; rendered a verdict of guilty against the said Patterson &amp; affixed his punishment at confinement in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary</orgName> at one year -- </p>
   <p>They allege that three reputable witnesses (Towit) <persName ref="cwgk:N00002276">James Taylor</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00008819">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wallace</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00000210">Elijah Gabbert</persName> stated on the trial of said cause, that they saw the prisoner at the time the alleged shooting was done, and they each stated they believed and were satisfied that the prisoner had not shot A G Kyle, nor had the prisoner fired at the said Kyle, And the said Kyle testified on trial of said cause that no ill feeling or bad blood had ever existed so far as he had reason to know or beleive between himself &amp; the prisoner,</p>
<p>But as jurors in the said cause they state that they beleive the case presents strong reasons for Executive clemency and they therefore pray your Excellency to grant him a full pardon for the commission of the above offence and they will ever pray &amp; c<pb/></p>
