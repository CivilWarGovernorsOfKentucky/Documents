Dear Sir:</p>
<p>As. I. was conizant of all the facts and circumstances in the case of <persName ref="cwgk:N00012252">Wm Schofield </persName>from his arrest up to his conviction, I deem it proper, to State <hi rend="str">that</hi> without going into a detailed account of the facts &amp; circumStances, that they were wholy inSufficient in my opinion to establish his guilt. I was his counsel up until he told me that he was going to plead guilty- He Still told me that he was not guilty; but Said he had rather plead guilty and get, (as he hoped by pleading guilty he would) only one year, than to lie in <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001161">Jail</orgName> until the next term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">court</orgName>.</p>
<p>I talked with his witness Some time before the trial, and if they could have been got there. I think <hi rend="str">y</hi>beyond a doubt that there testimony would have inSured an acquittal. But they had, Some of them left the State and others of them we did not know where they were; and he Said rather than lie in jail to the next court he would plead guilty. I then refused to defend him; and did not defend him on the trial. I have no contingent fee in this case; nor am I to be benefitted a farthing by his being pardoned. But I never did believe he Stole<pb/>
<lb/>the money; and I do not believe that the public weal requires that he Should be retained in Prison. And as it would So rejoice the hearts of his distressed <persName ref="cwgk:N00012324">mother </persName>and the whole family I do hope you will pardon him</p>
<p>Yours Truly
<lb/>L,, A. Wood</p>
