   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos E. Bramlette</persName> Governor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State of Kentucky</orgName></p>
   <p>Your petitioners <persName ref="cwgk:N00006643">H. M. Still</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00006644">L. M. Campbell</persName> would respectfully state that at the present <date when="1863-09">September</date> term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000477">Nicholas Circuit Court</orgName> a judgement was rendered against them in favor of the Commonwealth for Sixty Dollars for keeping a tippling house-- They state that they made application for license to keep a tavern at their <orgName ref="cwgk:O00010924">house</orgName> in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000537">Carlisle</placeName>, and paid the money to <persName ref="cwgk:N00006645">Jno. A. Campbell</persName> then clerk of the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000539">Nicholas County Court</placeName> and never knew but that the order had been made until an Indictment was returned against them in Court-- They immediately made application and took out license-- They acted in good faith, and with no intention of violating the law believing that the order granting them license had been made -- They refer to the statement below of <persName ref="cwgk:N00006646">W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Norvell</persName> Esqr who was at that time County Judge of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000539">Nicholas County</placeName> They pray that Your Excellency will interpose and remit said fine<lb/><date when="1863-09">September, 1863</date></p>

<p>I cheerfully recommend this Petition</p>
<p>W. Norvell</p>
<p>I was Judge of the Nicholas County Court, at the time specified in the above petition, and I recollect that Mr. Still applied to me in vacation, for License for the Tavern of Still and Campbell -- and I told him to go to the office, pay the Clerk &amp; tell him to prepare a bond, and I would at any time open Court and grant the License. I suppose the matter was afterward inadvertently omitted by the Clerk and Mr. Still.

<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am quite sure that it will be highly proper exercise of Executive Clemency to remit the fine imposed by Law on Messer Still &amp; Campbell. The State received the Remit. &amp; all was intended correct. and the county Judge &amp; Clerk more to blame than they I hope you well remit this fine</p>
