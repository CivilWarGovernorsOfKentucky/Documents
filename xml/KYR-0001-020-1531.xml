   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName> Govenor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName>. -- </p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003416">County of Jessamine</placeName> respectfully represent &amp; petition as herein set forth:</p>
<p>That John J. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee was arrested in the Town of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000278">Nicholasville</placeName> Ky-- on the <date when="1861-08-05">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1861</date> under a warrant for an alledged shooting with intent to Kill -- and on the <date when="1861-08-09">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the same month and year</date> he was tried for said offence before <persName ref="cwgk:N00003424">James G. Bruce</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00003435">James H Lowry Esqrs. </persName>Justices of the peace for said County as an examining Court -- &amp; by them adjudged that there were "reasonable grounds for believing that said Deft-- M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Afee was guilty of the offence charged" &amp; held him for trial before the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000408">Jessamine Circuit Court</orgName> in bail in the Sum of $4.000 &amp; Said M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Afee not then giving said bail was Confined in the Jail of Said County from that date till the <date when="1861-08-10">10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of August</date> ensuing when W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> H. Daniel, <persName ref="cwgk:N00003437">Nathaniel Welch,</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00003438">Edward Cosby</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00003439">John S. Welch</persName> became his bail in the sum named by the execution of the requisite Bail Bond before <persName ref="cwgk:N00003440">H. J. Campbell </persName>Presiding Judge of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000643">Jessamine County Court</orgName> -- for his personal appearance before the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000408">Jessamine Circuit Court</orgName> on the <date when="1861-09-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of its September Term 1861</date> -- The Said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee failed to make his personal appearance before Said Court as required by Said Bond &amp; the Same was so noted on the record of said ^court^ &amp; said Bond declared to be forfeited &amp; Summons duly awarded thereunder against Said Securities for the ensuing <date when="1861-03">March Term 1861</date> -- of Said Court. -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioners are Satisfied from all<pb/>
<lb/>the evidences and circumstances attending Said case and the Shooting charged that there are just mitigating facts and circumstances as to the alledged acting of Said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee which entitle him &amp; his said Securities as Bail to the Clement Consideration of Your Excellency. -- </p>
<p>The Shooting charged is alledged to have been done near the Court house in the Town of Nicholasville Ky -- on the <date when="1861-08-05">5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of August 1861</date> -- ^on election day -- ^at one W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell -- in a personal rencounter at the time and place between said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell &amp; one W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> H. Daniel for alledged political differences -- between whom several pistol shots were fired by each &amp; at each other. -- </p>
<p>At the time of said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee's examining trial it was believed and apprehended that said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell would die from the wound recieved -- but is yet alive -- &amp; as we understand is recovering &amp; now supposed out of danger of death resulting therefrom -- &amp; we think &amp; believe that Such apprehension of his probable death resulting had great weight &amp; influence with the examining Justices in affixing the Bail of Said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee so high as it was affixed -- &amp; which we then &amp; now regard as excessive -- &amp; we believe furthermore that in Consequence of the excessive &amp; extraordinary excitement on the part of said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee's enemies &amp; political adversaries ^against him^ in the present &amp; then political excitement it is now &amp; has been ever Since Said M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Afee was bailed out &amp; left -- as we think ^&amp; believe^ positively unsafe to his life for him to have ^made^ his appearance at the Circuit Court or in this County -- Since.</p>
<p>The evidence as developed in the case -- is<pb/>
<lb/>that at the commencement of the rencounter between M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell &amp; Daniel, that before the Shooting between ^them commenced,^ a third party one D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Young ^a partisan friend^ delivered to M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell a Pistol &amp; urged on him to fire on Daniel which ^he done^ in advance of any <hi rend="str">of</hi> fireing by Daniel -- &amp; so soon as they exausted their shots they each closed &amp; M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell was on Daniel &amp; had him down on the ground &amp; in the act of Strikeing Daniel on the head with his pistol when it is alledged that M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Afee (as the personal &amp; political friend of Daniel under the excitement of the moment &amp; under a Seeming Simultaneous pressure of the friends of each party) ran in &amp; fired a single pistol shot at M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dowell -- &amp; here the whole affair ended -- </p>
<p>We therefore petition your Excellency for your clement interposition in behalf the Securities in said Bail Bond -- <date when="1861-09-16">Sept 16 1861</date>.</p>
