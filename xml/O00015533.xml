        <p>Court of Common Pleas in the State of Ohio. The 1802 Ohio Constitution established a court of common pleas in each county. The state was divided into three circuits, each with a president, who must reside in that circuit. Each county elected two to three associate judges for their court of common pleas. In the 1851 constitution, the state was divided into nine compact districts, each of which were in turn divided into three subdistricts. One judge of the court of common pleas for said subdistrict was elected by the electors of his subdivision.</p>
