<lb/>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">T. E. Bramblet</persName> Gov. of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Ky</orgName>.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00006292">John Delaney</persName> says he was lately tried in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000477">Nicholas Circuit Court</orgName> to wit, at its <date when="1864-09">last September</date> Term for stabbing <persName ref="cwgk:N00007776">John Barnett</persName> in a sudden heat of passion- and was fined the sum of $50.</p>
<p>He says the proof was that Barnett had threatened to shoot him which was the Cause of the stabbing- The stabbing was done with a pocket knife &amp; did not inflict a Very serious wound -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioner would state that he is subject to fits which he is satisfied affects his mind &amp; causes the least thing some times to throw him into excitement of an uncontrolable character &amp; this &amp; not the provocation he believes caused the cutting- Barnett &amp; himself were on good terms, but ^Barnett^ was made mad by Your Petitioners hitting him in the face with a snow Ball- He says he &amp; his Mother &amp; another replevied the fine but he is poor &amp; not able to pay it- He therefore asks its remission &amp; will ever pray &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>-</p>
<p>John Delaney</p>
<p>We were jurors in Delaneys case above &amp; we think the fine ought to be remitted</p>
