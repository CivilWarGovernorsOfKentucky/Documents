        <p>Lexington, Kentucky, educational institution founded by John Bryan Bowman and chartered by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. First housed in the former Bacon College building in Harrodsburg, from 1858 to 1864. Building destroyed by fire on February 16, 1864. Consolidation of Kentucky University and Transylvania University on February 28, 1865, created the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky as provided under the Morrill Act of 1862, but it was not opened for students until October 1, 1866. The name of Kentucky University was retained until 1908 even though classes were held on the Transylvania campus. The College of the Bible, which later became Lexington Theological Seminary, was created within Kentucky University from 1865 to 1873.</p>
