   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>:</p>
<p>Your petitioner, <persName ref="cwgk:N00017989">Julia Dean</persName>, humbly prays your Excellency's Clemency. She fears that when apprised of her situation in life, you may be disposed to turn towards her a deaf ear, yet, on the Mother's appeal to the Executive of the Commonwealth, a reference to the conduct and services of her sons in support of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Government</orgName>, may not be disregarded, but serve as a <hi rend="str">favorable</hi> reason for a favorable Consideration of her prayer. Your petitioner has three sons, all of whom have been, &amp; two of them now are in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">Military service of the U. S. Government</orgName>.</p>
<p>The first, <persName ref="cwgk:N00018020">Sam<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Rasure</persName>, in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, belongs to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00018799">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Indiana Regiment</orgName>, which he joined at <placeName ref="cwgk:P001820">Indianapolis</placeName> a year ago last June; he was in the fight at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00017980">Baton Rouge</placeName>, also at the taking of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002303">New Orleans</placeName>, where your petitioner believes he now is, and he is still in the U. S. service.</p>
<p>The second, <persName ref="cwgk:N00018000">David Rasure</persName>, in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, was in the 3 month's service in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001037">Virginia</placeName>; &amp;, afterwards, at Indianapolis, in <date when="1861-06">June, 1861</date>, joined <persName ref="cwgk:N00018018">Capt Rabb</persName>'s battery, with which he still remains as first gunner; and, during the time he has been engaged in the difficulties in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00005654">Kansas</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001883">Missouri</placeName>.</p>
<p>Her other son, <persName ref="cwgk:N00018022">Geo W. Rasure</persName>, in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, was for two months a member of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00004685">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Kentucky Cavalry</orgName>, but, being young &amp; too delicate to undergo the hardships of the service, was honorably discharged.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that her conduct, in an unguarded moment, as is too often the case,<pb/>
<lb/>has brought her to lead the life she does -- yet it is uncessary to refer to the past -- she admits that her manner of life is punishable by law; her steps she can't retrace, and, though she is fallen, she keeps as well regulated a house, as any of the kind in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">the City</placeName>.</p>
<p>She states that in consequence of an <persName ref="cwgk:N00018025">inmate of a house in her neighborhood</persName> becoming affected with liquor and boisterous in the streets, attention was called to that house, &amp; the <persName ref="cwgk:N00018803">keeper of it</persName> being indicted for keeping a house of prostitution, was fined. This led to your petitioner being also indicted for the like offense, for which, on the <date when="1862-09-03">3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Sept, 1862</date>, she was fined, in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001838">City Court of Louisville</orgName>, the sum of $100; this fine, your petitioner, being poor, is unable to pay, and, in default, of payment, she, as your Excellency is aware, is liable to be sent to the city workhouse. She therefore humbly prays your Excellency to remit to her the Commonwealth's portion of said fine which will still leave her 30 per cent of the fine to pay to the prosecuting attorney, besides the costs in the case, amounting, in all, to $44.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>.</p>
<p>Though your petitioner can urge little in her behalf, still she hopes that the Mother will not have to be sent to the workhouse, for a debt to <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">the Commonwealth</orgName>, while her sons are in the Military service of the Government.</p>
