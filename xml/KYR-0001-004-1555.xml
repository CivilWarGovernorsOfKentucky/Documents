<p>W. L. Johnson states that he saw James James the day before he is charged with attempting to burn Wades house and for which he has been convicted, and made a settlement with him, James told him he was going to leave this country and go to Louisville and again join the federal army, that he could not live here, he did not say why, but affiant supposed it was from the fear of the Gurillas who were numerous in this country He has known James 8 or 9 years his character has been good during that time, before he went into the army he was not a drinking man. but after he had joined the army he discovered that he was drinking too much. When he had the above conversation with me he was sober, he told me he should go that night to his brother, Fielding James or to his brother in, law Rowen Goin, and go from there the next day to Cave city and take the Cars for Louisville, I learned that he did stay that night at his Brother Fielding James, to go to <unclear>Cave</unclear> city, from his brothers Glasgow would be the nearest place and proper rout, to get conveyance by stage or hack, and which for that purpose is the usual rout</p>
<p>Fielding James states that his brother James James did stay at his house the night alluded to by Mr Johnson and told him, he was going to Louisville to join the army, for he was afraid to stay here any longer on the account of Gurillas, and was going through Glasgow, and did so start next morning</p>
