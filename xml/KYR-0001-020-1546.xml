<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00003612">Angelo Devoto</persName> an Italian who lives in this city <hi rend="str">and</hi>was convicted at the last <date when="1861-05">May</date> term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName> of receiving stolen property knowing it to be stolen.<lb/> 
 <lb/>Altho the accused had lived in this city for some time past he had never before been charged with any offence. The verdict was that he should be confined in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentary</orgName> for one year. Devoto is now in our <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001161">Jail</orgName><pb/>
<lb/>and has been <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str">since</hi> in<orgName ref="cwgk:O00001161"> Jail </orgName>for nearly eight months. He was not sent to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> on his conviction because of his application to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000311">Court of Appeals</orgName> for a new trial I am of the opinion that he ought to be pardoned. He is a man of very feeble frame and if sent to the Penitentiary would probably die before the expiration of his term of service</p>
<p>I therefore respectfully suggest to you and earnestly hope that you will pardon him</p>

He kept a small confectionary by which he supported his very helpless family He is a very obscure man, an Italian who knows <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>scarcely any thing of our language</p>
