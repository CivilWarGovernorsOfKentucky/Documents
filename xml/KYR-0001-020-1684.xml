   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>The undersigned Jurors who tried the Indictment against Maria N. Johnson on a charge of having in her possession Counterfeit Gold Coin with the intention of circulating the same, at the present term of the Campbell Circuit Court state that the evidence conduced to show her guilt &amp; they were constrained by the law &amp; facts to find a verdict against her &amp; the fixed her punishment at the lowest time the law will allow. They further state that James Johnson whom they believe to be her husband, was at the same time convicted with her as accessory -- That the said Maria N., is an old Woman &amp; has several small children<pb/>
<lb/>needing her care &amp; protection especially during the imprisonment of her said Husband &amp; under such circumstances &amp; in view of the further fact that the conviction &amp; the imprisonment of near two months which she has already suffered will tend to reform her course of life they recommend her to Your Excellency as a fit subject for Executive Clemency.</p>
<p><date when="1862-02-21">Feby 21. 1862</date>.
<lb/>We recommend the foregoing.</p>

<p>The names of the Jurors who convicted Mrs Johnson appear in the first column they are all good men. Mrs Johnson is an old woman about 45 years of age &amp; has several small children Who need her care no charges have been made against her heretofore The signatures of the jurors are genuine. I join in asking the Executive Clemency in her behalf.</p>

<p>I am Satisfied the Commonwealth will not suffer any by releasing the old woman </p>
