   <p>To <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">his Excellency the Governor</persName> of the Commwlth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00007347">John Mayhan</persName> will state that some time since he was Indicted in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000380">Fulton Circuit Court</orgName> charged with keeping a Tippling house and was at the <date when="1861-05">May term of said Court for 1861</date> fined the sum of sixty dollars,</p>
<p>He states that prior to the finding of said Indictment one <persName ref="cwgk:N00007348">Dr. Wit Beadles</persName> had from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000624">County Court of Fulton County Ky</orgName> obtained a license to keep a Tavern in said County which he did keep &amp; also kept a bar which he imployed your petitioner to keep, and for this he was Indicted &amp; fined, &amp; when he came to make his defence, the same was ruled out by the Court, upon the grounds that the Bar was not attached to the Tavern house,</p>
<p>He states that he &amp; Beadles had been informed &amp; so understood that under the recent laws of Kentucky, that it was not requisite that the Bar room &amp; Tavern house should be attached, &amp; such was the general understanding &amp; the opinion of some of the judges &amp; attornies, &amp; relying upon this the Bar room was used as sugested &amp; in this way they <hi rend="str">at</hi> led into error &amp; have been fined, He states that he acted in good faith, not suspecting<pb/>
<lb/>that he was in the least violating any law Wherefore he asks that said fine be released</p>
<p>John Mayhan</p>
<p>We whose names are hereto annexed would state that we are acquainted with John Mayhan, That he is a good orderly citizen &amp; hope your Excellency will grant his request in the release of said fine,.</p>
