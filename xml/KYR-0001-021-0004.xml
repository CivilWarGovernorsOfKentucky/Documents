   <p>At the request of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00015076">Jailor</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000869">Montgomery County</placeName> I am pursuaded to address you a letter informing you of the escape of three prisoners from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00015073">Jail </orgName>of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> County while in his custody <persName ref="cwgk:N00014421">Isaac Hall</persName> one of the prisoners was arrested in the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000478">County of Bath</placeName> as the Indictment alledges, for malicious shooting and wounding with the intent to Kill and failing to give bail in the penalty of $1000, as required, and the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00015072">Jail of Bath County</orgName> being insufficient, as the Indictment states he was ordered to the Jail of Montgomery County, and on friday night last together with two other prisoners broke the Jail in said county and made their escape. <persName ref="cwgk:N00015071">Henry King</persName> another of the prisoners was tried in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001936">Mtsterling</placeName> last week before the <persName ref="cwgk:N00015074">police Judge</persName> of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Town upon the charge also of shooting with the intent to kill and failing to give bail in the of $500, as required by the court he was committed<pb/>

<p>The Jailor finding it to be his duty to make every effort to have the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> <hi rend="underline">felons</hi> recaptured, though it prudent to write you a letter upon the subject. I saw the Indictment in the Jailors possession authorising him to receve and safely keep Isaac Hall and was present when Henry King was tried for shooting with the intent to kill, I am only informed as to the charge against Richard King which is said to be rioting. The Jailor informs me also that Isaac Hall is the same man your Honor pardoned last spring, ^convicted^ for passing counterfeit money &amp;c I remarked to the Jailor that I would write the letter, Given under my hand as presiding Judge of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00011050">Montgomery County Court</orgName> the <date when="1860-11-12">12 day November 1860</date></p>
