<p>I know the task will be an embarassing one to you but I feel that you will not let the body of such <unclear/> go begging the rites of Christian burial.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N001002">George W. Johnson</persName> was born in this county on the spot where <hi rend="str">J</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00008185">Junius R Ward</persName>'s house stands. <date when="1811-05-27">May 27 1811</date>.

I know through a confederate prisoner that he saw him fall. That he was on <persName ref="cwgk:N001789">Breckenridges</persName> staff till a short time before his wound, when his horse being killed under him (not the day before) he immediately fell into the ranks with a gun<pb/>
<lb/>and was in a short time wounded.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008230">Judge Duvall</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00008231">Paul Rankin</persName> can give you any incidents in his life and character you desire</p>
<p>A brief discourse only will suffice though should you act I shall leave everything in regard to it entirely to your own judgement.</p>
<p>I shall be in town by 9 oclock and I hope <hi rend="str">I</hi> will not be disappointed in my expectations</p>
<p>Pardon this hurried note and believe me</p>
