   <p><orgName ref="cwgk:O001028">Louisville</orgName>, <date when="1862-07-29">July 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency. <persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Governor Magoffin</persName>, of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00003057">Paul Garras</persName>, referred in petition, Started from Louisville, to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003061">New Haven</placeName> <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName>. about the <date when="1860-05-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of may 1860,</date> to take possession of a saw &amp; grist Mill, belonging to <persName ref="cwgk:N00003063">W. Carden</persName>, located on <geogName ref="cwgk:G00009916">Rolling-fork</geogName>. When he began at S<hi rend="sup">d</hi> mill, he had about a Capital of $1800, he then employed, <persName ref="cwgk:N00002936">Erhard Duplain</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00002937">Antony Julien</persName> (this latter, now deceased) I, Vander Espt was living at that time with Paul Garras, and remained with him until he left, which was towards the <date when="1861-04-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> or <date when="1861-04-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of April 1861.</date> Regarding the intemacy S<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to be existing between he Paul Garras, and a certain colored girl <persName ref="cwgk:N00002938">Cirella</persName>, property of <persName ref="cwgk:N00003058">Jack Dawson</persName> of New Haven, I know, and it was known ^that^ She was washing for the inmates of the House, (Garras) that is abut two months, ^after^ he Garras, was in that locality Dawson, the master of the Girl knew it, that She was washing for him; The <date when="1860-12-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of December 1860,</date> I married, and consequently, occupied a room in the house, where the girl Civilla, frequently called on <persName ref="N00002943">Mrs. Vander Espt</persName> to learn how to make her own dresses. Towards the beginning of <date when="1861-04">April,</date> Erhard Duplain, <hi rend="str">a</hi> named above, made a trunk for me to pack up my books &amp;c, therefor, the idea, that is was made for the girl is false and erroneous, as I had it made for my own use, but being too Small, I, gave the trunk to the girl Civilla, Paul Garras, did not order the trunk for running her off as intimated by those who wished his ruin. The girl put her clothes at <persName ref="cwgk:N00002944">Mrs Hayes</persName> close by our residence, fearing that her Master, perhaps would not allow the Slave to keep the trunk.</p>
<p>Garras, funished lumber, and flour &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi> and to <hi rend="str">his</hi> Dawson his sons, amongst whom was <persName ref="cwgk:N00003059">William</persName>, who owed</p>
<p>(To Hon Beriah MaGoffin, Governor.)
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> Ky.<pb/></p>
   <p>owed him a certain am<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of money Garras called several times for it, he intending to go South, at <placeName ref="P00003065">little Rock</placeName>, <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002510">Ark.</placeName> This vexed Dawson's family and without any just a cause, they accused him of attempting to run away the girl Civilla. After he had left New Haven, where afterwards returning, the furious mob, wished to hang him, as if he had been a Disciple of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00017925">John Brown</persName> the Abolitionist; that imputation to Garras was unjustly founded his intentions were not at all to run off the Slave either North or South, Having spent nearly all he possessed on the Mill he was compelled to look after earning his livelihood. He now, is in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001003">Memphis</placeName>; previously to his trial in New Haven he had to undergo a severe vexation, and gave bail for his appearence but finding no employment in Louisville, he went to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001004">Nashville</placeName> from Nashville, following the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Southern army</orgName> to Memphis, acting as Mill wright &amp;c. The case appearing in <date when="1860-12">December last</date> neither he Garras, nor principal witnesses could be got. <persName ref="cwgk:N00004234">Herrin Joseph</persName> his Security, could not do any thing in this case. The character of Garras is known to be good, as well as of the Security, the latter, in giving bail for his countryman done it with a pure motif of benevolence towards Garras, his case not being criminal; Herrin, acted the part of a humane man, although not knowing Garras particularly,, but in these trying times, he might have been exposed to ill treatments had he P. Garras remained in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00017922">prison</orgName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004617">Bardstown</placeName>. I have perhaps written too long a letter to your Excellency regarding what I know of the case concerning Garras, and Herrin, In Justice to both, I cannot but ^to^ say, that one and the other are good and peaceable citizens, and respectfully Submit to your Excellency what I know concerning this case. If my humble letter, can be accepted by our worthy Governor, in Justifying both of the party referred in, I will as ever, remain grateful, and Subscribe myself, most Respectfully &amp; Sincerely;</p>
