    <lb/>Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Ky.</orgName>
<lb/>Governor -- </p>
<p>I have learned this morning with sincere regret that the Dept. has refused to commission Sgt. <persName ref="cwgk:N00012740">Mark Wallace</persName> of this Regiment as a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Lieutenant for the alleged reason that he was formerly in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Rebel service</orgName>.</p>
<p>The facts in the case are briefly these, Sgt. Wallace was induced to meet with some persons who were about to ^proceed to^ the Rebel lines with the intention of entering the Rebel service. Mr. Wallace desired to leave the party but was forcibly detained and when the men were captured he gave useful and important information that enabled us to destroy the organization to which they belonged. Since that time Mr. Wallace has been constantly with the Regiment and gave material aid in recruiting it. He is, and has been a zealous <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Union</orgName> man, He has three brothers in the<pb/>
<lb/>service two of whom are Officers. All of his family are for the Govt.</p>
<p>I have been an Officer in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">U. S. service</orgName> for more than six years and aided in the capture of the men by whom Mr.. Wallace was detained and I am very sure that I would never solicit the appointment of any man whose devotion to the Union admitted of the slightesd question of doubt.</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00005702">Genl. Burnside</persName> released Mr. Wallace from the custody of the Federal troops with the highest praise for his conduct in the whole affair.</p>
<p>I am very sure if your Excellincy will induce <persName ref="cwgk:N00000879">Genl. Boyle</persName> to reconsider the action of the Dept. you will do justice to the claims of a very worthy man and give great pleasure to the officers of this Regt.</p>
<p>I am, very Resp'y.
