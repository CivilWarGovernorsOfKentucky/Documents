   <p>The sad tidings of <persName ref="cwgk:N001002">your husband's</persName> decease will have reached you before this falls into your hands. As I was with him in his last moments, I have thought that a word from me would be acceptable. He was wounded in the abdomen, the ball passing through the body, He lay on the battlefield some thirty hours, before he was found and brought to our hospital. He had every possible attention both from physicians and nurses. But his wound was so fatal that no human skill could possibly save him. I need not tell you that he suffered most intensely, but he bore his sufferings with manly firmness. He was conscious to the last and talked freely of his decease -- put his papers into the hands of a friend of which you will be notified in due time. I brought his body to this place from here it will reach you by express<pb/></p>
<p>You may be assured that your deceased husband had every possible attention and every thing was done that could be done to alleviate his sufferings, and smooth his descent to the dark valey and shadow of death. I sang several hymns to him besides talking with him freely for all of which he seemed truly gratful</p>
<p>I am compelled to write in great haste, should you wish any farther particulars, I will gladly communicate any information that I may be in possession of at your request</p>
