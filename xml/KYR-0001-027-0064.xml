<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I do not intend to obtrude my opinions upon you, but feel it to be my duty to give you a few military facts--</p>
<p>Chapter 1st</p>
<p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> I arrived here at one O'clock P. M. on thursday &amp; found <persName ref="cwgk:N00010076">Gen Dumont</persName> encamped, with a large force, of Infantry, with Several batteries &amp; some 1.000 or 1500 Cavalry on both sides of the river --, his advance having aided in driving out <persName ref="cwgk:N00010085">Scotts</persName> cavalry-- (a few hundred) the night before &amp; prevent<hi rend="str">ed</hi>ing them from burning the bridge. -- (2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>) On friday morning I received the following information from Mr <persName ref="cwgk:N00010135">Scarce </persName>(a true Union man) from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002991">Versailles</placeName> -- (See paper No 1.) and went with him-- first to <persName ref="cwgk:N00010082">Genl Grainger</persName> -- 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> in Command, located with his troops, on the Dudley farm, who replied that he could not move without orders -- I then took Mr <persName ref="cwgk:N00010135">Scarce </persName>to Genl Dumont &amp; urged him, <hi rend="underline">at once</hi>, to send <persName ref="cwgk:N00010082">Genl Grainger</persName>s division-- Say 1000 Cavalry one or two<pb/>
<lb/>Batteries of some 4 or 5 Regiments of Infantry in pursuit, via <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002991">Versailles</placeName> to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000278">Nicholasville</placeName> &amp; as far as the bridge, at the mouth of Hickman, -- hoping thereby to overtake the enemy -- cut off his heavy trains -- <hi rend="underline">in part</hi> -- &amp; save the bridge.</p>
<p>3rd On Saturday, Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00010087">Miller</persName> was sent to Versailles with Several thousand Infantry -- some Cavalry &amp; artillery -- reaching there that evening &amp; capturing some 150 Rebels, -- I presume the Sick in the hospitals. He remained there till 12 or 1 Oclock yesterday &amp; <hi rend="underline">then</hi> started in pursuit. After marching a few miles, towards Nicholasville &amp; finding no enemy, he <hi rend="underline">faced about</hi> &amp; camped, last Night, 3 Miles on this side of Versailles. What he will do next-- God knows, I have no idea.</p>
<p>4<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Genl <hi rend="underline">Granger</hi> marched also on Saturday with a large force of Cavalry &amp; Infantry with one or two Batteries, towards <hi rend="str">Lousville</hi> <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001867">Lawrenceburg</placeName>, which he reached about dark, drove out the enemy in considerable force &amp; <hi rend="str">afterwards</hi> captured some prisoners. -- <pb/></p>
<p>What he has since done, I have not heard. So much for Genl Dumont &amp; his army.</p>
<p>Chapter 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi></p>
<p>A gentleman well known to you M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00010083">D. E. Harcourt</persName> arrived here last Night from <placeName ref="cwgk:P001838">Georgetown</placeName>, who walked up from here on Saturday &amp; gives me the following information--</p>
<p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> At Elkhorn bridge he was stoped by Capt <persName ref="cwgk:N00010088">White</persName>, at the head of about <hi rend="underline">eight</hi> Rebels Cavalry, <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>who cautioned him not to tell he had seen them, as they were looking out for Federal Pickets.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Genl <hi rend="underline">Pratt</hi> reached Georgetown yesterday at 3 oclock P. M. and gave M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Harcourt the following information, which he hastened to communicate to Genl Dumont last Night &amp; to me this Morning Viz That he had left <persName ref="cwgk:N001014">Genl Burbridge</persName> with a large column of Infantry, Artillery &amp; cavalry at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002296">Williamstown</placeName> (Say 9000) &amp; understood that Genl <persName ref="cwgk:N00000820">Green Clay Smith</persName> was at the head of a similar Column on the great State dirt road to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00005772">Cynthiana</placeName>-- all waiting<pb/>
<lb/>for orders &amp; to hear from Genl <hi rend="underline">Dumont</hi>; Reminding me, very much, of the remarkable pursuit of <persName ref="cwgk:N00004777">Morgan</persName>, on his late raid -- when two columns -- each large enough to whip him, (if well commanded) after coming up with him at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000514">Paris</placeName> -- <hi rend="underline">rested</hi> <hi rend="underline">a</hi> <hi rend="underline">day</hi> <hi rend="underline">&amp; night</hi> &amp; then pursued him in double <hi rend="underline">Slow</hi>-time.</p>
<p>Remarks</p>
<p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> I would stake my life, &amp; so told Genl. Dumont, that there is not, at this time, &amp; was not on yesterday-- 1000 armed Rebels -- all told-- North of the <geogName ref="cwgk:G00010089">Kentucky River</geogName> &amp; yet these large columns, instead of moving ahead rapidly on <persName ref="cwgk:N00003001">Braggs</persName> rear &amp; supporting Genl <persName ref="cwgk:N002042">Buell</persName>, will wait on each other till they can do no good &amp; then march into our rich counties &amp; consume or destroy all that the Rebels have left us.</p>
<p>Respectfully Your
<lb/>Most Ob't. Sv't.</p>
<p>His Excel. Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Robinson</persName><pb/></p>
<p>Paper No 1</p>
<p>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Scarce informed me &amp; I wrote to Genl Dumont &amp; told him that a column of Rebel Infantry (say 5000 or 6000) left Versailles on the Nicholasville Turnpike Wednesday-- Evening-- leaving only some 150 sick in the hospitals -- That Genl <hi rend="underline">Scott</hi> left there with all his cavalry, except Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00010086">Stearns</persName> Regiment, which was encamped at Harts farm, on this side of Versailles -- about 2 oclock thursday afternoon &amp; was followed by Col Stearnes at 7 oclock the Same Evening-- towards Nicholasville -- That a large train of Waggons which had started towards <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000555">Harrodsburg</placeName>, was brought back &amp; sent off also on the turnpike road to Nicholasville &amp;c &amp;c. He had also received reliable information that with the exception of a small cavalry force, all the Rebels left <placeName ref="cwgk:P001002">Lexington</placeName> Wednesday-Evening in haste and Confusion.</p>
