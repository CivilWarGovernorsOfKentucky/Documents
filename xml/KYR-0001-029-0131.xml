<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Mrs <persName ref="cwgk:N00017933">Brafford</persName> the Mother of <persName ref="cwgk:N00017610">Lafayette Brafford</persName> who is now confined in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penitentiary of the State</orgName> calls on us to give a statement of his conduct and character. we will state we have known Mr Brafford from 8 to 10 years he has been in our employ for near that time and was at work with us at the time of the misfortunate transaction for which he was convicted.</p>
<p>We will say for Mr Brafford that during his whole time with us he was a quiet good peaceable hand and a hard working young man. and we think if he had not been led astray he would at this ^time^ occupy a respectable position in society.</p>
<p>We hope and ask in behalf of his <persName ref="cwgk:N00018843">Wife</persName> Children and aged Mother that you could reprieve him and let him return home to his family</p>
<p>Yours
