<lb/>His Excellency.
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas E. Bramlett</persName>.
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Some months since a man by the name <persName ref="cwgk:N00012835">Marion Rowland</persName> who has for sometime been under a bad reputation was brought before me charged with having stolen a lot of coffee from a Grocer in this city which was found at the House of <persName ref="cwgk:N00012830">Michael Fahay</persName></p>
<p>On the Examination of the case Fahay was Introduced as a witness &amp; proved that he was working on the farm of a Brother in Law of Rowland, that Rowland came to his house at night &amp; brought the coffee giving some account of haveing purchased it &amp; asked him to keep it for him till the next day. &amp; he not suspecting that it was stolen, consented &amp; took charge of the coffee, The party who lost it gave Information of his loss to the police &amp; they found it at the house of Fahay, on this &amp; other Testimony as to Rowlands character. He (Rowland) was held to answer in the Circuit Court-- When the case was taken up by the Grand Jury they returned <hi rend="str">A</hi> a Indictment against Fahay &amp; discharged Rowland</p>
<p>Fahay was arrested &amp; committed to Jail an M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N002037">R. A. Hamilton</persName> who was familiar with the proof in the case &amp; being satisfied that Fahay was Innocent became his security for his appearance in the circuit court in the sum of $300. Fahay who is a verry Ignorant man became alarmed &amp; failed to appear &amp; a forfeiture of the recognizance was Entered<pb/>
<lb/>and Judgement will be entered at the next Term, unless your Excellency will remit the penalty; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hamilton was Induced solely by his kind feelings. to become the security of Fahay. &amp; not for any pecuniary consideration</p>
<p>I would be glad to see him released from the liability; I feel well assured that Fahay was Innocent of any Intentional wrong. and was Induced to runaway because of the alarm &amp; fear of a Trial opperating on a weak mind</p>
<p>I am D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir verry
<lb/>respectfully yr obt serv<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
