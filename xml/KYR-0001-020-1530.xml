<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00003358">Miles Malin</persName> says that at the last May Term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000396">Hopkins Circuit Court</orgName> a fine of sixty dollars has adjudged against him for the alledged Crime of Keeping a <hi rend="underline">Tipling</hi> <hi rend="underline">house</hi>. He states that he was a Merchant in good faith and sold liquor by the quart, that if any of the same was ever drank upon his premises he did not know it and it has was so done if done at all, Contrary to his expressed directions -- but finding that some of the witnesses would prove the charges upon him that they had bought the liquor and had drunk the same on the premises without the authority of Affiant, and being advised by his Counsel that that would Convict him and that it would be better to let Judgment go and appeal to the Executive, he did Confess Judgment and that is the only foundation for said Charge &amp; Judgment -- He says that he had Merchants License to sell Liquor, at the date of the alleged Charge</p>
<p>He therefore prays your Excellency to remit said fine as he was guilty of no intentional Offence against the laws</p>
