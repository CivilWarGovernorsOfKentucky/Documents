   <p>To his excellency, <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas E Bramlette</persName>, Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00012430">Isaac Sharrow</persName> would show unto your excellency that at the <date when="1856-08">August term of the </date><placeName ref="cwgk:P001011"><date when="1856-08">Garrard</date></placeName><date when="1856-08"> Circuit Court 1856</date>. he was fined $50. upon a charge of assault &amp; battery -- Now your petitioner states that he used no knives or deadly weapons, and if he could have attended the trial he could have shown that he was a peacemaker instead of a violator of the law; but your petitioners health was such that he could not attend the trial, and in this way was fined -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he will be Sixty five years old the <date when="--03-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of March</date> next, and has a very sickly <persName ref="cwgk:N00013332">wife</persName>, most of the time in bed, and unable to aid him by way of making a living. That he has a home, but with his farm and all he can do, he is not able to gain a support; and if it were not for the help of his boys in the army, he could not make a support. That he has <hi rend="underline">Seven</hi> sons and grand-sons in the Union army, all of whom were reared by him. That he has <hi rend="underline">Thirty two</hi> close relations fighting for the Union- That <hi rend="underline">Three</hi> of his sons were in the battle of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00009726"><hi rend="underline">Chickamauga</hi></placeName>, and he does not know whether they were killed or not.</p>
<p>He hopes that all will be right, but if necessary, old as he is, he will go into the service sooner than this <orgName ref="cwgk:O00002945">Government</orgName> shall fail.</p>
<p>Your petitioner would respectfully ask your Excellency<pb/>
<lb/>to remit this fine, as it would break him up to pay it, and the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName> will not be injured by the remission of the same.</p>
