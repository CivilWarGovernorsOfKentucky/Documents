<lb/>My Dear <persName ref="cwgk:N00008172">Mother</persName></p>
<p>I suppose before now that you all have heard of dear father death and the manner in which he was killed in the late battle. I went with <persName ref="cwgk:N00008241">Captain Keene Richards</persName> on the sunday after the fight with a flag of truce to learn what we could in regard to what they had done with him. I saw Gen Nelsen of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName> and he told us that my father was taken on monday morning wounded. At the time he was wounded he was fighting in <persName ref="cwgk:N00008242">Col Tribue's</persName> regiment on foot, his horse having been shot as I have learned the day before. O mother what an untarnish name he has left behind him and what a legesy to his family and to his children.</p>
   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00008225">Gen Nelson</persName> told us that father suffered from his wounds none whatever and he died on <hi rend="str">then</hi>the <date when="1862-04-09">9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date> and that his remains would be sent to you in Ky. I start this evening to brother <persName ref="cwgk:N00008203">Willa</persName> with fathers things which he had left with <persName ref="cwgk:N00008239">Arnold</persName>.</p>
<p>Brother Willa and all of our friends of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00008146">Old Town</placeName> and <geogName ref="cwgk:G00008192">Lake Washington</geogName> are well when I last heard from them.</p>
   <p>Dear Mother I know you will excuse bad writing and my short letter, as you know to tell you that I am well is about all that I can write these times since I can not write what I would like to. Give my love to <persName ref="cwgk:N00008197">Grand-pa</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00008243">Grand-Ma</persName> and all my relations -- Kiss brother <persName ref="cwgk:N00008217">Euclid</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00008216">Henry</persName> for me -- Tell <persName ref="cwgk:N00008221">Cousin Mary</persName> the <persName ref="cwgk:N001789">General</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00008363">Cable</persName> are both well. With the hope that I may see you all again I am your affectionate son<pb/></p>
