<lb/>Sir</p>
   <p>We beg leave to warn you &amp; the authorities at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> of an imposition designed to be practised on by <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">the Rebels</orgName> &amp; Rebel sympathisers here -- You are aware no doubt of the several Guerilla Raids which have been upon us lately in which they have entirely disarmed all the loyal men here, taken all the horses they could &amp; all the money &amp; goods they desired besides causing the rather premature death of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00003084">S. B. Pell</persName> Shff of the <placeName ref="cwgk:P001816">County</placeName> by the effects of personal ill treatment operating on a Constitution already enfeebled by disease -- after their first raid here the loyall men were gratified that <persName ref="cwgk:N00003146">Capt Hendrick</persName> proposed to become Provost Marshall here &amp; ^that he is^ <hi rend="str">has</hi> also now as ^we^ hear raising a company under a Commission from the <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Gov</persName> to protect the Town &amp; County -- after his appointment of Provost Marshall Capt H-- proceeded on the Gun Boat at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00003671">Cannelon</placeName> &amp; bro<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in down to make some arrest here in consequence of complicity
<lb/>(over to last page)<pb/>
<lb/>with the Guerillas when here &amp; the news being promptly carried to this same band they returned here several days post in search of the Capt &amp; a few others swearing that they would take their lives-- The Capt however &amp; the others fortunately escaped over <geogName ref="cwgk:G001825">the River</geogName> -- Now the Rebels here have been just detected in getting up a secret petition to the Gov to countermand the Commission of Capt H-- and ^it^ is against this insidious appeal that we wish to warn you &amp; through the Gov. at Frankfort--</p>
   <p>all loyal men here that we are aware of vary much desire that Capt H. be permitted to raise his men &amp; use them for our protection -- and ^if^ any other information reaches you it is false and insidious -- a man by the name of <persName ref="cwgk:N00003071">Sanford</persName> here considered here as a spy &amp; imposter is named in the paper we saw as bearer of the paper to the Gov-- &amp; in it he is claimed to be a loyal Man-- but all of us consider him as cunning &amp; <unclear/> Yankee Rebel-- For the unconditional loyalty of the first undersigned he refers you to the editor of the "Press" or to <persName ref="cwgk:N00003080">J. M. Stephens</persName> of your City, and <persName ref="cwgk:N00013890">your father</persName> in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001809">Brandenburg</placeName> whom he was with a few days past -- ^The^ Public office of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> name is surely enough for his loyalty</p>
<p>Resply in haste
