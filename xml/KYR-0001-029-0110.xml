<lb/><hi rend="underline">Eldred E Pate Clk</hi><pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned members of the bar in attendance when the trial of Caughfield took place certify that it was proven on the trial that the said Caughfield was a poor demented person with but little of any business inteligence, indeed some of the witnesses gave it as their opinion that he had not sufficient mind at the time he was charged with the violation of the Statute to know right from wrong, whilst others thought he had sufficient mind to know a little about business matters, but very slight= </p>
<p>It was also proven that by reason of his constant inebriation and general inability of person &amp; mind, his wife was the only dependence for support of himself and family. they having some small children </p>
<p>We further certify that his condition has been and is as bad at present as it was at the time above referred to, and from all evidences is likely to continue so until <hi rend="underline">whiskey</hi> <hi rend="underline">does</hi> <hi rend="underline">its</hi> <hi rend="underline">work</hi> f<hi rend="underline">or</hi> <hi rend="underline">him</hi>= And that if the fine of $60. is collected it will be a sore infliction upon Mrs Caughfield and the little children, and take from her her hard earnings, which is scant enough indeed for a family in the situation of hers -- We would respectfully urge the Governor of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName> to exercise his executive clemency in this matter and respite the fine to the limit of the law. The ends of public Justice will be exemplified by so doing in our opinion</p>
