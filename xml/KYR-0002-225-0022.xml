   <p><placeName ref="cwgk:P001014">Columbia Ky</placeName> <date when="1862-11-08">Nov 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date>
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000228">Jno W Finnell
</persName><lb/>Adjt Genl. Ky <hi rend="str">Caly</hi>Vols.</p>
<p>Your dispatch of yesterday authorizing me to raise a Cavalry Regt for 3 years service was somewhat of a surprise to me- My application was in favor of <persName ref="cwgk:N00007662">Capt Morrison</persName> for an extension of his authority,</p>
<p>Having been repulsed in all my efforts to get authority at a time when I thought the danger was imminent &amp; required the active efforts of all true Kentuckians; I had abandoned all thought of going into the service; and made up my resolution to stand upon my personal defense; and aid my neighbors and fellow citizens to the extent of my ability in making for this unprotected &amp; suffering part of the State such defense as we best <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>might.</p>
<p>This entire front- from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004831">Wayne</placeName> to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00008528">Monroe Conuty</placeName> being still exposed:- and being the principal entrance for the rebels into <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Ky</placeName>, makes it of the utmost importance to the security, of not only the border counties, but Central Ky, that something be done to ensure future security.</p>
<p>But the border countries (especially <placeName ref="cwgk:P001032">Clinton</placeName> &amp; Monroe) having already sent so many of their brave men to the field -- being left continually exposed &amp; undefended- &amp; that I am not willing<pb/>
<lb/>enlist those <hi rend="str">in</hi>who remain in a new Regt to be sent off and leave their homes wholly unprotected. -- If it is proposed to use the forces which I may raise in defense of our border, and State, I will raise the Reg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>. Or if I am assured so that I can assure the people of these border counties that there will be protection given to them; if they enlist, I will go forward and raise the Reg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> -- But I cannot ask another man to enlist in this part of the State until I can assure them either that they will be retained for defensive purposes or that other forces will take their place &amp; give the much needed protection from guerrilla raids. -- Before I take any action I wish to know what is the proposed employment of the Regt should it be raised -- Also when and where can they be armed and equipped. Are the Arms ready<hi rend="underline">?</hi> It will not do to get them up &amp; have them unarmed; as it would expose them to attack in a defenseless condition. -- Many of the men who volunteered to go into the Regt which I offered the Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> have been hunted down &amp; killed. If I move in this matter I wish to have arms for the men as fast as Companies are organized so they will be able to defend themselves should <persName ref="cwgk:N00004777">Morgan</persName> or other guerillas attack them<pb/>
<lb/>I go tomorrow to the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000366">Casey Court</orgName> will be at home by the time your reply can reach here; and will proceed to raise a Regt if the object be to employ it for <hi rend="underline">efficient</hi> and not <hi rend="underline">nominal</hi> defense..</p>
<p>I hold that the way to defend Kentucky is to Keep the rebels out of it- not wait till the invade and then when they <unclear/> Run out the State Give them back -- They should be kept out, and to keep them out; a force that will <hi rend="underline">fight</hi> and not run &amp; would be ready to meet them at the threshold and not only whip them but as far as practicable destroy them. I shall await your answer &amp; be ready to act when it comes</p>
<p>Respectfully
