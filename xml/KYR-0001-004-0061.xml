    <lb/>ining court &amp; the circuit court that he was mistaken in relation to the Guilt of Renfro &amp; the Roses &amp; failed to prosecute them further in fact he learn that a squad of Rebels took his goods a they were on their way to the southern army and that Renfro &amp; the Roses were innocent These are the facts The commonwealths atty will recollect them as detailed to him when here -- Brumback &amp; stone can pay the $500 but will greatly oppress them they are both poor men with Families dependent upon them I believe you would under the circumstances be justified in remitting the Judgment except the percent going to the Commonwealths Atty -- I sent a copy of the judgment &amp; others papers some time ago to <persName ref="cwgk:N00001597">G W Craddock</persName> asking him to present them to you but have not heard from the papers I hope you will find that the facts in this case commend themselves to your clemency</p>
