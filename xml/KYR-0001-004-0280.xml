<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Gov Bramlette</persName></p>
<p>Dear Sir, At the late term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000426">Mason Circuit Court</orgName>, I was fined for selling spiritous liquors to a <persName ref="cwgk:N00002897">slave</persName>- upon an agreed statement of facts, a copy of which together with a Copy of the judgment I enclose- I have kept a Bar in Maysville for a number of years, and have always endeavored to Comply with the strict letter and Spirit of the law- I knew that I had no right to sell liquor to a slave and always refused to do so without the permission of the master. I knew the boy to whom the liquor in this instance was sold, to be the slave of my neighbor <persName ref="cwgk:N00002898">Samuel W Wood</persName>, but I knew that he was hired to a <persName ref="cwgk:N00002900">free negro barber</persName> who also kept a shop a few doors from me, The negro boy Came in with the barber to whom he was hired, and his temporary master told me to let him have a drink of whiskey, and supposing I had a right to do so under this authority I sold the boy a drink for himself and his temporary master. Poliltical excitement was bitter at the time and I was indicted for selling, although S W Wood Cared nothing about the matter, and allthough it was the only drink the boy ever took at my bar -- I respectfully request your excellency to remit so much of the fine as by law you are permitted to do -- as the balance makes a sum as large as I am able to pay</p>
<p>Respectfully <persName ref="cwgk:N00002896">Peter Miller</persName><pb/></p>
