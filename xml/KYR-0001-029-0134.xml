<lb/>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">James F. Robinson</persName> -- 
<lb/>Gov. of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I enclose herewith the verified petition of <persName ref="cwgk:N00007119">William Beaucamp</persName> as also a petition signed by a good number of his neighbours asking your Excellency to reprieve said Beaucamp from the prosecution two Indictments pending against him in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000379">Fleming Circuit Court</orgName>. And I would respectfully <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">state</placeName> that I am personally acquainted with Beaucamp and all or nearly all the persons who have signed his petition -- I was also to some extent cognizant of the affray between Beaucamp and <persName ref="cwgk:N00007120">Keithly</persName> -- and I am of the opinion that Beaucamp tells the truth about it in his petition -- I moreover believe that his prosecution is not desired, and that as he desires to leave the state I respectfully unite with others <hi rend="str">a</hi> in praying your Excellency to reprieve him -- Beaucamp is a mechanic, industrious and respectable -- with a large and helpless family of little children -- Keithly is a very disreputable, bad man -- I trust you will consider it consistent with your duty to reprieve Beaucamp -- </p>
<p>I am Dear Sir

<p>His Excellency Jas. F. Robinson
<lb/>Gov. of Ky,
<lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>
<lb/>Ky.</p>
<p>Examined
<lb/>The grounds for relief in this case are all reliable before a Jury &amp; will in all probability there avail -- It is a very dangerous exercise of Executive power to omit the trial by jury. Surely no ground that it is inconvenient to the accused to await &amp; atttend the trial -- The Executive in my opinion should not interfere in the <unclear>present</unclear> prosecution of this case</p>
