   <p>To His Excellency the <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor of Kentucky</persName></p>
<p>Your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00004115">Charles Catlett </persName>&amp;<persName ref="cwgk:N00012447"> J H Vanderipe</persName> state that at the <date when="1861-04">April Term 1861</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000424">Mercer Circuit Court</orgName> that they entered into recognizance <hi rend="str">f</hi>before said Court for the appearance of <persName ref="cwgk:N00012480">Charles Westerfield</persName> who was indicted for misdemeanor and Trespass therein in the penalty of Three Hundred ^Dollars^ for his appearance on the Second day of <date when="1861-07">July Court to be held for the said Mercer circuit Court in the year 1861</date>. </p>
   <p>That said Westerfield left and went into the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Southern army</orgName> and had returned to his Brother in laws in Mercer County early in <date when="1861-07">July 1861</date> and these petitioners being his bail captured and delivered him to the <persName ref="cwgk:N00010534">Jailor of Mercer</persName> county on the <date when="1861-07-03">3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Day of July 1861</date> in discharge of their recognizance</p>
<p>That said Westerfield was afterwards on the <date when="1861-07-05">5 July 1861</date> bailed out again before <persName ref="cwgk:N00001866">Judge C Chinn</persName> Judge of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000659">Mercer county Court</orgName> having been brought before said county Judge by and of Habeas corpus and gave recognizance for his appearance in the Mercer circuit Court on the Second day of the next term thereof with <persName ref="cwgk:N00004092">Dudley Barnett</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00012479">David A Davis</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00012477">Thomas Hutson</persName> in the penalty of three Hundred Dollars which bond <hi rend="str">of</hi> for the said purpose executed in the penalty of 300$ and now on file in the Mercer Circuit Court<pb/></p>
<p>Your petitioners supposed and believed that they were finally and fully discharged by the surrender of said Charles Westerfield and that they were no longer responsible for his appearance</p>
<p>They understand that <unclear/> on the <gap/> day of <gap/> 18<gap/> said <hi rend="str">bond</hi> <hi rend="str">or</hi> recognizance entered into by them as aforesaid was forfeited and that summons issued against them to shew cause why judgt should not be rendered against them returnable to Oct Term <date when="1863">1863</date> on said recognizance</p>
<p>They employed <persName ref="cwgk:N00003207">Mayor W A Hooe</persName> to attend to said case and who told Petitioners that he would attend to it and have it dismissed, but neglected to do so and Judgement was rendered against your petitioners for the sum of 300$ with costs <unclear/> the penalty of C Westerfield forfeited recognizance &amp;c on the <date when="1863-10-15">15 Oct 1863</date>. that Petitioners were not aware of the fact of Judgement being rendered agt them <unclear>both within</unclear> the last week when the sheriff showed them the execution &amp;c.</p>
<p>They state that said recognizance should not have been forfeited as against them but against his subsequent sureties towit Barnett Davis &amp; Hutson. That in law equity and Justice they are not responsible and should not pay one cent of said Judgement<pb/></p>
<p>Your petitioners state that they are poor men and cannot pay the said Judgement and unless relieved by your Excellency will be incarcerated in Jail for said debt</p>
<p>They therefore pray that you will remit said Judgement &amp; costs &amp;c.</p>
