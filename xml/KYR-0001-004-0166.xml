<lb/><note place="header">9</note></p>
<p>Addenda by Com' atty It was proven by the officer who made the arrest that as soon as he heard of the commission of the offense he went in search of deft -- went to his house-- could'nt find him,--returned to the city &amp; still could'nt find him &amp; then posted himself ne<hi rend="str">r</hi>ar defts house &amp; after waiting some time saw defts wife drive up to defts house in a wagon--get out--unharness the horse milk the cow, bring water &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi> &amp; at length return to the city in the wagon -- Officer followed ^her^ to a certain house in the city where he found deft--who, as soon as he saw policeman, made haste to escape--</p>
<p>It was also shown that in one of the matrasses in Shenebergers house (by officer) there was found (in the inside of the matrass) a soldiers overcoat of such material as is generally<pb/> 
<lb/><note place="header">10</note>
<lb/>furnished by the U S to her soldiers which evidently presented the appearance of having been dyed. The officer described the color as being the same color &amp; the coat as being the same kind of coat which Mrs Newton stated she had dyed herself &amp; as having been taken from her house. It was <hi rend="str">shown</hi> stated by Officer who made arrest that Shenneber spoke <hi rend="underline">intelligible</hi> English when arrested, that at that time he understood his conversation without any difficulty &amp; that while at Shennebergers he looked over frequently towards Newtons &amp; while at Newto<hi rend="str">t</hi>ns he looked over towards Shennebergers &amp; that there would be in his opinion no difficulty in seeing the upper half of the form of a man, when standing in either door ^in entering the door of the other house^--the witness spoke positively that the fences which were between the places<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">11</note>
<lb/>did not preclude the possibility of one's being recognized from one tenement to the other -- thought not only that it might probably ^be^ done but was positive the fences did not so obstruct the view as to prevent its being easily done -- com atty"</p>

<p>This case upon the facts presents some difficulty in to the identity of the Deft-- The uncertainty of all human evidence is one of the great difficulties in <unclear/> truth</p>
<p>The Jury are the chosen triers of fact-- I cannot say that their verdict in his case is wrong or even that I would have found differently. I do not think the case is one for Executive interference</p>
