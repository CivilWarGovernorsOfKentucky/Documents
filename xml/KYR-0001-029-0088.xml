<lb/>Dr Sir,</p>
<p>The enclosed papers were transmitted to me to send to you for a remission of the fine of $20. imposed on <persName ref="cwgk:N00017479">Judge Adams</persName> by his <persName ref="cwgk:N00008740">Successor </persName>in office, in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001759">Greenup County</placeName> Having met you but once in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName> some several years ago, under such circumstances that you may not recollect me, I felt that I had no such acquaintance with you as would authorize you to rely upon any recommendation of mine. I therefore handed the papers to your old friend <persName ref="cwgk:N00017568">Col. Stevenson</persName>, who knew the parties and whose impressions of the case you will find written in pencil on one of the papers.</p>
   <p>The <orgName ref="O00000311">court of Appeals</orgName> have decided in a recently famous case that a Judge's insisting on trying a case after there is an affidant against him for a change of venue is ground for reversal. It seems to me, from reading the papers, that there was such haste and impetuosity in this case as showed the personal ill will of which the Defendant complained -- And as the paper<pb/>
<lb/>in question was filed in time for the regular duties of the Court, no good end can be accomplished by requiring a poor man these hard times to pay a fine of Twenty dollars, inflicted in ill tempered haste.</p>
<p>I therefore cheerfully unite in Col. Stevenson's recommendation for a pardon</p>
   <p>Should your excellency grant one, will you please transmit it to <persName ref="N00002432"><hi rend="underline">Jeremiah</hi> <hi rend="underline">Davidson</hi></persName> <hi rend="underline">Greenup</hi> <hi rend="underline">County</hi> <hi rend="underline">Ky</hi></p>
<p>With high respect
