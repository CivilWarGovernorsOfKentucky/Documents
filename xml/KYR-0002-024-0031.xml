<lb/>To his honor The <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor</persName> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State of Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>Believing that you have a great interest in the wellfare of every Kentucky Soldier I make bold to write you this letter trusting that you will kindly help me in this matter, as I well know that you have the power to befriend me if you see fit</p>
<p>I am a soldier of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00006406">7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Kentucky Infantry</orgName> and have served honestly with them since the organization of the Regiment</p>
<p>I was court martialed on the <date when="1864-04-24">24<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of April/64</date> charged with desertion and was sentenced to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00013389">Tortugus </placeName>for the period of time of the war. In the charges against me it was alleged that the offence was committed <date when="1863-07-10">July the 10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi>/63</date> and I have been in arrest since that date and although on three different occasions I demanded a trial it was not granted me till nearly one year after the offence was committed</p>
<p>The facts in the case are these I was absent from my Regiment for a period of 9 days during which time I was so unwell<pb/>
<lb/>as to be totally unable to join the Reg<hi rend="sup">t</hi> and at the time was returned to the Regt in arrest was immediately sent to hospital. I believe that these facts are sufficient to fully exonerate me from the charge of desertion on which charge I have been unjustly condemned.</p>
<p>After being returned to the Regt from the hospitol I demanded a trial instead of a trial I was furnished with a gun and returned to duty. I was doing duty till the <date when="1864-02-22">22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> feby/64</date> when I was ordered to confinement and was kept in confinement till the time of trial</p>
<p>Hoping that your honor will will not consider this impertinent in me and that you will do what is in your power for a native of your state and one who has always been a good citizen, and has a motherless and friendless child at home</p>
<p>I remain your honors
