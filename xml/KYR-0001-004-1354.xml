<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Gov. Bramlette</persName><lb/>Dear Sir</p>
   <p>There is a very <persName ref="cwgk:N00001180">poor woman</persName> in this neighborhood who appeals to your clemency</p>
<p>some time ago her so<hi rend="str">m</hi>n got into a difficulty in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000537">Carlisle</placeName> and to keep him from going to jail <persName ref="cwgk:N00001179">Noah Goodpasture</persName> (his father) went his security and swore he was worth the required amount, now the only property they have is some land <hi rend="underline">bought</hi> and <hi rend="underline">owned</hi> by the wife and Mother and earned by her hard labor now she fears if this money is not paid her husband will be prosecuted and taken from his family.<pb/>
<lb/>The <hi rend="underline">young</hi> man has left the state and thereby accomplished what the citizens of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000537">Carlisle</placeName> desired.</p>
<p>In view of these facts I hope you will feel that it is not inconsistent with your duty to remit the penalty as far as Noah Goodpasture is concerned I think it is $500 -- </p>
<p>With my best wishes for you</p>
<p>I am very Respy
<lb/>Yr friend
