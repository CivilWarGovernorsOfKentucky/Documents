   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos. E. Bramlette</persName> Gov. of the State of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName>.</p>
<p>Your petitioner <persName ref="cwgk:N00017702">Henry Thomas</persName>, f. m. c. would respectfully state, that at the <date when="1864-12">December</date> term of of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001838">city court of Louisville</orgName>, he was fined $50, &amp; costs, for carrying concealed a deadly weapon -- a pistol --.</p>
   <p>He says that he was not in the habit of carrying this, or any other weapon; but being engaged at <orgName ref="cwgk:O00019040">Willard's Hotel</orgName> as a Servant, he one night Started to go upon Preston Street a distance of Some half mile, to his <persName ref="cwgk:N00017703">washerwoman's</persName> house to get his clothes, he put a pistol in his pocket; and on his way he got in company with two other colored men, and one of them run against a <persName ref="cwgk:N00017704">white man</persName> and jostled him Somewhat. Thereupon the white man drew a pistol, ordered your petitioner ^and the others^ to halt. The two others ran away, and your petitioner stoped; and the white man took him and delivered him over to a <persName ref="cwgk:N00017705">Policeman</persName>, who Searchd him, and finding on him a pistol he was put in Jail. Afterwards he was indicted &amp; fined as af'd.</p>
<p>Your petitioner says, that he did not run against the white man, nor did he intentionally or otherwise offer any insult or indignity to him. Your petitioner says that about that time the city was infested with Robbers &amp; thieves, who nearly every night assaulted and robbed or atempted to robb persons on the Streets; and Such outrages upon colored persons were frequent; and<pb/>
<lb/>that he only took the pistol along with him to protect himself against such assaults. He Says that he is a poor man that it requires all he can make to Support himself; and that if he has to pay the whole fine &amp; costs Some $65 or more, he will perhaps have to work it out or a part of it in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00012610">city work-house</orgName>. This he thinks would be very hard, as he had not harmed any one nor intended to; nor did he intend to violate any law</p>
<p>He therefore prays your excellency to remit all except the attorney's fee, and costs.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Henry Thomas, f. m. c</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Louisville, respectfully present that we Know the above pititioner; and that we think his Statements are Substantially true. Some of us, <persName ref="cwgk:N00017698">Mr Willard</persName> &amp; his clerks, would State that he is a most excellent Sevant: a Sober, Steady well-behaved, industrious man. And we most earnestly request your Excellency to remit all of Said fine which you have the power to.</p>

<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
