<lb/>To His Excellency.
<lb/>Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos. E Bramlete</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>He would respectfully state that on the <date when="1862-11-26">26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of November 1862</date>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00004744">James H Smith</persName> was tried before an examining court for <placeName ref="cwgk:P001011">Garrard County</placeName> for Maliciously shooting <persName ref="cwgk:N00004745">Joshua Burdett</persName> on the <date when="1862-11-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> oof said Month</date>, and was held to bail for his appearance at the next succeeding <date when="1863-02">Feby Term</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000386">Garrard Circuit Court</orgName>. in the sum of one thousand dollars -- that the undersigned. <persName ref="cwgk:N00012459">John J Huffman</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00012551">M H Gill</persName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00012561">S Hopper</persName>. <persName ref="cwgk:N00012558">J W. Grant</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00012560">H Jackman</persName>, with one other, <persName ref="cwgk:N00012557">Richard West</persName>, entered as the sureties of Smith in said bond -- and one of the principal objects we had in view was to enable Smith to return to his command, he being a Captain in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00013049">12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky V.I.</orgName> It was thought on the day of trial that Mr. Burdett was recovering from the wound, but unfortunately it proved otherwise -- he lingered until about the <date when="1862-12-12">12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Decr 1862</date> and died- Smith failed to appear<pb/>
<lb/>in discharge of the recognizance at the <date when="1863-02">Feby Term 1863</date>. and thereupon the bond was declared forfeited, and process was awarded to <date when="1863-08">Augt Term 1863</date>. against the obligers in the bond, &amp; was returned by the Sheriff executed on all but Smith and one of the sureties, Richard West- The latter having in the meantime removed out of the State- and at the <date when="1863-08">Augt Term 1863</date> Judgment was rendered upon the forfeited recognizance against said sureties who had been served with process, towit, Huffman, Hopper, Grant Gill &amp; Jackman</p>
<p>They would further represent that at the time they entered as sureties aforesaid they believed Mr Burdett was in a fair way to recover and that the bond was sufficient to secure the appearance of Smith- Smith has not been heard of since M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> B'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> death although a large reward was offered for his apprehension.</p>
<p>The amount of the bond &amp; costs for which Judgment was rendered as afs<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> are about to be, and will be coerced out of the said sureties by writ of execution<pb/>
<lb/>or otherwise unless your Excellency interpose the Executive Clemency &amp; remit the same -- Such are the facts, -- a true &amp; plain history of the case.</p>
<p>They therefore petition to be released from the obligations of said bond and the Judgt aforesaid, or so much thereof as is compatible with law &amp; public Justice.</p>
<p>John J Huffman</p>
<p>In view of the circumstances, &amp; the hardships attending the suretyship as set forth in the foregoing petition, we cheerfully Join in the prayer there of to His Excellency Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bramlett <hi rend="str">for</hi> to remit the penalty imposed.</p>
