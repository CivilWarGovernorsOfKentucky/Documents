   <p>&amp;#9758; We have just seen a friend of ours, a <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName> surgeon, who was at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002629">Pittsburg Landing</placeName> during the late battle. He came up on the boat that arrived here on Sunday, and says, that, of the wounded on board, sixty were rebels. He states that <persName ref="cwgk:N001002">Geo. W. Johnston</persName>, the Provisional Governor, so-called, of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>, was mortally wounded on Monday, and left on the field, like many hundred other wounded rebels, and that he died on board of one of our boats on Wednesday. <persName ref="cwgk:N00000811">Col. James S. Jackson</persName> cut a lock of hair from his head and took a letter from him for his <persName ref="cwgk:N00008172">wife</persName>. Our informant read the letter.</p>
