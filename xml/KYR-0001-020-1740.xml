<lb/>Govenor Maggofin
<lb/>D Sir,</p>
<p>The grand jury in this city during the present term, indicted B. H Elliston, a Hotel Keeper of the City of Eighteen years standing, for Keeping a Tippling House; -- This <hi rend="underline">legally</hi> <hi rend="underline">true</hi> but in <hi rend="underline">point</hi> of fact <hi rend="underline">untrue</hi> -- Mr Elliston Keeps the best House in Covington and has for years; no man in Ky would be further than he would be in trying to evdate the Revenue laws of the State, and the Indictment is simply for Keeping a house without license which you Know however well and orderly Kept, the law, makes it per see a Tippling house if Kept <hi rend="underline">without</hi> a <hi rend="underline">license</hi>.. Mr Elliston thought his license had not <hi rend="underline">expired</hi>, he saw the clerk of the county court (Judge Perrin) who informed him he would give information when a <hi rend="underline">renewal</hi> of his license was necessary and promised to look to it for him -- He relied on the Clerk, and <hi rend="underline">he</hi> <hi rend="underline">forgot</hi> it -- and hence the indictment -- as the penalty is a high one, and the<pb/>
<lb/>cost large -- M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Elleston, has thought it advisable to ask a pardon or release of the penalty <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> this will save considerable to him and in these days of "Hard times" a penny is worth "Salvation" -- You will remember I have troubled you but little since you have been Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> about matters like the present -- but I know B H Elliston well, and can (as I now do) vouch for his truthfulness and integrity. I therefore ask you "to give relief and Heaven will bless your store"</p>
<p>The<hi rend="str">s</hi> ^above^ letter is <hi rend="underline">to</hi> you as Governor. -- I now write you, as a citizen -- How vastly difficult ^is^ our country's condition than that which it was, in when I first saw you, in a democratic Convention more than Twenty long years ago -- <hi rend="underline">and</hi> <hi rend="underline">you</hi> made a democratic speech in a large Blanket coat" how well do I remember it -- circumstances, I need not refer to them, for which neither you or I was able responsible caused us to differ in choice of candidates <hi rend="underline">in</hi> our <hi rend="underline">party</hi> some years ago</p>
