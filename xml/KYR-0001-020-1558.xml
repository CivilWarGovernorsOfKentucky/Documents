<lb/>It has been extensively reported that Estes was verry drunk at the time and that the Tomlinsons was herd insisting on his going the direction of the lane, insisting that was his way home we were surprised to Know that persons liveng but a Short distance, beleeved that and other reports that we Know to be utterly false which has a great deal to do in creating, and Keeping up the prejudices against the Tomlinsons most of the people of the surrounding country are related to the Estes family</p>
<p>The Tomlinsons were the best if not, the only true friends Tom Estes had</p>
<p>I was a bright moon light night and and Estes Knew just as well where he was and what he was about as the Tomlinsons did </p>
