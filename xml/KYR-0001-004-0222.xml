<lb/>Governor &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p>Dear sir, At a former term of the Mason Circuit Court, two females- Mary Ann Hazlett and Sweeny Swise were indicted for Stealing some small articles of Merchandize from the dry goods store of Geo Cox &amp; son of this City &amp; being unable to give bail are confined in the Jail of Mason County, Both Girls were young and one was in delicate health Geo Cox of the firm of Geo Cox &amp; son an old and humane man, could not bear the idea of their incarceration for taking so small a sum from him, and he voluntarily became the security of the Girl Mary Anne Hazlett in the final sum of &#36;100- and John Swise, together with Joseph Coryell became the secuity of Sweeny Swise conditional for their appearance to answer said charge The Girls failed to appear and judgment has gone against the bail in each case. Jno Swise is verry poor &amp; the payment of the sum adjudged against him and Coryell will ruin him. Geo Cox is able to lose the sum adjudged against him, but it seems to me that it ought not to be exacted of him under the circumstances. I therefore respectfully re<pb/>
<lb/>request your Excellency to release the parties from so much of the penalty as may belong to the State</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>J. C. Campbell</p>
<p>Dr Gov.</p>
<p>As a general rule I am much opposed to the exercise of Executive Clemency in remitting fines &amp;. But I am <hi rend="underline">Well</hi> Satisfied that the application here is one of Merit and one that justice requires Should be granted</p>
<p>Your frd
