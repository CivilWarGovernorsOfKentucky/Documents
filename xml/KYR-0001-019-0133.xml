<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Beriah Magoffin</persName><lb/>Govenor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Comth of Ky</orgName></p>
   <p>Sir in Compliance with the request of Senator <persName ref="cwgk:N00003952">Johnson</persName> we send a Certificate of our arrest and detention at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004801">Cairo Ills</placeName> (by the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">Federal troops</orgName>)</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> inst. there was considerable excitement in our village from the Heavy Canonading and incesent fireing of Musketry in the direction of sairo Ills and <placeName ref="cwgk:P00010603">Birds Point Mo</placeName>, And to learn the Cause of it, we mounted our Horses and rode down to the River we had Scarcely reached the River, when met with Some of the Citizens of our town (Blandville) riding down the river in great haste they informed us that a company of Soldiers had Just landed off the Ferry Boat from Cairo and were coming down the river. we paid no attention to them but rode on in the direction of the Soldiers. as we had Some business in the neighbourhood. and intending to return Via James House<pb/>
<lb/>a short distance <unclear>over</unclear> there was a Horseman Riding very Swift, Came in Site of us. Halted and blew a very Shrill whistle, immediately returned, Still riding very fast and then there came about 100 or 150 Men armed with Muskets came running up on us they demanded of <persName ref="cwgk:N00007143">Stovall</persName> his pocket Book and papers <persName ref="cwgk:N00007146">J. Watson</persName> ^had^ none with me. he (Stovall) had a small memorandom book, a mustar Roll belonging to <persName ref="cwgk:N00002126">Jos Bishop</persName><hi rend="sup">s</hi> Company of Home Gards and a letter from Some of the Boys at Camp Boon <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tenn </placeName>there was two negores in the Company ^(with provisions)^ and while the officers were consulting in regard to the disposition to be made with us. one of the Negroes Said By God if they turned all the Prisoner's loose we had as well close the war and go home. after the examination of the papers we were Marched up the river to the ferry ordered to dismount and Sent Cairo the Head Quarters of Col <persName ref="cwgk:N00006923">Ogelsby</persName> After our arrival, <hi rend="str">w</hi> the Men were asked what we were, they Said Prisoners of War this was about (Noon) Colonel Ogelsby requested us to remain until he returned as he had Some important business at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00006999">Mound City</placeName>. and would return Soon. and have a conversation with us we hoped he would Soon return as we both had Families. Would hear of our arrest and have some<pb/>
<lb/>Some uneasiness. Near dark the Company Crossed the River with our stores, it was Some time after dark when the Col returned to Head Quarters, he questioned us some time about Cavalry men being in our county and about Union Men being in danger of the Cecesionists, to which we told him it was all false, there was no Horse Company<hi rend="sup">s</hi> at this time in the County, and we knowed Union Men were perfectly safe. </p>
<p>We told him we were detained from our Businsess and wanted to be released one of us was Post Master and the other Constable and belonged to no Companies contrary to the laws of Ky or the U. S. that we were Citizens of Ky and wished to abide by the laws of the Same. that if the Neutrality of Ky Could be observed and Keep out of the dificulty we would be satisfied. The Cole did not Speak well of the Neutrality of Ky. that it was all a Humbug- of Course there was no dispute on that point as we believe it nothing but a <hi rend="str">pith</hi> mith, Col Ogelsby, told us if we would bring a man with whom he was acquainted to endorse for our honstey he would release us. that he did not want to punish Honest Men= that there had been men<pb/>
<lb/>Communicating with a Spie in his Camp and that he intended to have them at all Hazards, and this was why he had Sent his men to Ky-, we referd him to <persName ref="cwgk:N00002214">C, S, Marshall</persName> Judge of this County who is a Gintleman. well Known in this Count<hi rend="str">y</hi>ry we Sent a telegram to Judge Marshall who went immediately to our relief The Colonel treated us like Gentlemen and Some of the officers were very polite to us= Some others treated us like felons Ma<hi rend="str">k</hi>de insulting remarks, So that we Could hear them, which was there <hi rend="underline">intention</hi> (I suppose -- ) I (Stovall) asked the liberty of looking throug a Magnifying Glass at Some men Crossing the River which was very Vulgarly refused, we were Keped in the<orgName ref="cwgk:O00006958"> St Charles Hotel </orgName>and had the Fare that the officers had only slept on a cot. we Eat two meals while <hi rend="str">o</hi>in Custody Suppose we were there about Forty four Hours.</p>
<p>our Horses were badly fed and one of them Badly abused his head is bady Bruised and one of his Eyes bady<pb/>
<lb/>His Eyes badly Hurt I cant tell whether it is out or not we went back to Head Quarters to see Col Ogelsby about the damage of the Horse he was gone but am satisfied he would have given Satisfaction <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>for the damage done him. As I think the Col is a gentleman more than worthy the position he now fills. Although in a bad cause he will long ^be^ Known and respected after the close of this War let it Terminate As it May. but May the curses of an avenging God fall heavily upon Some of the other officers.
