   <p>Head Quarters "Defenders"
<lb/>Col. Morris Three Months Men
<lb/>Camp Recovery <date when="1862-09-11">11 Sept 1862</date>
<lb/>To the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000228">Adjutant General</persName><lb/>Sir</p>
<p>please in form his <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Excellency</persName> that I brought my men here last night by rail, together with our arms and ammunition. Today the field piece with our cavalry arrived <hi rend="str">and</hi></p>
<p>The moment of my arrival I barricaded the entrances to this place and stationed strong guard at each ^entrance^ thereby thwarting an intended attach by guerillas who as I learn today had arranged to enter the town ^last night^ by two or three detachments. Squads of two and three ^each^ of these marauders visted a number of places ^last night^ within four miles of this and stole horses. By a rough estimate I should say that 100 horses had been stolen from this county and 50 recruits secured for the enemy since I was called to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> last Saturday.</p>
<p>Our arrival produced great consternation among them<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">2</note>
 <lb/>and today they are hurrying from all directions towards <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>. If we can gather in our forces rapidly we hope to prevent their return to this <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000758">county</placeName>.</p>
<p>Today I mustered in my first Company, <persName ref="cwgk:N00004710">Capt G. W Sewalls</persName>. The men are chiefly from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000758">Henry Co</placeName> and exiles. 2 Other Companies will be ready by the <date when="1862-09-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</date></p>
<p>We captured 2 horses (one a valuable mare) left in the neighborhood this morning by the haste of their owners who were out stealing others. If I had 200 good horsemen today I could bag a number of them</p>
<p><date when="1862-09-12">Sept. 12 1862</date></p>
<p>This morning I send a detachment of 26 men under <persName ref="cwgk:N00004709">Capt Luckett</persName> to Henry Co. under the following orders:</p>
   <p>"<hi rend="underline">Ordered</hi> That L<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Luckett is hereby detached in charge of a squad for the purpose of Recruiting the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00004708">First Regiment of Kentucky State<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">3</note>
    <lb/>Guards</orgName> encamped at this place for the ostensible purpose set forth in our bills. He is authorized to press such horses as will be suitable for Cavalry service, capture arms, and arrest every man who has taken an active part in favor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. and Report to these Head Quarters"</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00004598">S. W. Hunt</persName> L<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Col.
<lb/>Comg. State Guards.</p>
<p><date when="1862-09-13">Sept 13. 1862</date></p>
<p>Ammunition for the field peice arrived.</p>
   <p>Our detachment returned at day light bringing 3 prisoners viz <persName ref="cwgk:N00004711">James Ferguson</persName> of Henry Co charged with being on his way to join the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000506">Southern Army</orgName>. <persName ref="cwgk:N00004707"><gap/> Abbott</persName> charged with the same <persName ref="cwgk:N00004706"><gap/> Smith</persName> charged with abetting the rebellion. Also <hi rend="str">anu</hi> 10 horses and a number of recruits. Capt Luckett raised the Union Flag in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000305">New castle</placeName>, the previous one having been torn down<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">4</note>
    <lb/>by a squad of Secessionists and used for a saddle blanket. He visited <placeName ref="cwgk:P00004575">Campbellsburg</placeName> and made arrangements for recruiting the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000902">Home Guards</orgName> for my Regiment. Every where the loyal citizens received them with joy and ample hospitalities were tendered them.</p>
   <p>I hope to make similar demonstrations tomorrow in the direction of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002066">Shelbyville</placeName> and <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001508">Bedford</placeName>. It is needed to remove the paralyzing fear which the guerilla system has spread over the land.</p>
