<p>A message from the Governor by R. M.<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kee Secretary of State:
<lb/>Mr President: I am directed by the Governor to lay before this Council a special message in writing:</p>
<p>Executive Office
<lb/>Bowling Green Ky
<lb/><date when="1861-12-11">December 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date></p>
<p>W. B. Machen President of the council of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>I hereby enclose to the council a letter from the Governor of Tennessee- The Hon<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> Isham G. Harris- containing joint resolutions of the Legislature of said state of Tennessee</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt Servt

<p>His Excellency The Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Bowling Green -- Sir -- </p>
<p>I have the honor to transmit<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">64</note>
<lb/>herewith, a copy of Joint Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of Tennessee</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Isham G. Harris</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Joint Resolutions</hi>
<lb/>To take steps to open the Ports of the South to the Commerce of the World.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Resolved</hi> by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee.
<lb/>That as the sense of this Legislature, the following propositions are submitted for the Planters of the South and all others whom it may concern:</p>
<p>1. That the present Cotton crop of the Southern States is, to at least two of the leading powers of Europe, a <hi rend="underline">National necessity</hi>.
<lb/>2. That as under present circumstances, it seems improbable that the crop can be disposed of, the planting of another will place two crops on hand for sale at once.
<lb/>3. That the purchase of these two crops by ^the^ European Power<hi rend="sup">s</hi> above referred to, will give them a supply for two years, so that at any time when about to purchase the third crop, and having one year's crop to run upon, and the planter being unable to hold his third crop until they are compelled to buy, they will have it in their power to dictate the price and terms of sale.
<lb/>4. That on the other hand, the European Power<hi rend="sup">s</hi> before mentioned having exhausted their present- supply. and another crop not being raised, when those Powers come into the Market to buy, as they <hi rend="underline">must and will</hi>, if we adopt this policy, the Planters holding the great staple, which is a <hi rend="underline">necessity</hi> to them, they will not only be compelled to <hi rend="underline">buy</hi> but also to pay a remunerative price.
<lb/>5. The armies of the South cannot subsist on Cotton, but must have bread and meat, and while the interest of the Cotton. Planter calls to him to plant no more cotton than will supply the home consumption patriotism imperatively demands that his whole force should be turned into those channels, in which he can contribute to the wants and wastes of a war of which none can predict the end.
<lb/>6. That the vital interests herein involved: may be submitted to the enlightened Judgment of the South, the Governor of this State is requested to forward forthwith a copy of these resolutions, to the President of the Confederate States who is herein requested to submit them to Congress and also the several Governors of the Confederate States who are herein requested to submit them
<lb/>to<pb/>

<p>The Committee to whom was referred the Governors message relative to the appointment of delegates to the Congress of the Confederate States of America and accompanying documents beg leave to report; That after due consideration they deem it advisable that the council should now elect ten Delegates to said Congress, one from each Congressional District as the State is now districted.

<lb/><note place="header">68</note>
<lb/>And so the bill passed
<lb/>Ordered that the title be as reported.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>The Chairman Of the Committee on Foreign Relations reported as follows Viz:</p>
<p>The Committee on Foreign Relations report that since their last report Kentucky has been admitted into and become a part of the Confederate States of America. Both the Provisional and permanent Constitutions of Our Confederation declare that: "No State shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation" the President of the Confederate States "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate having the power to make treaties. Hence a committee on Foreign Relations in this body has become unnescessary, and a Committee on Confederate Relations nescessary: and therefore the Committee recommend that this Committee be dispensed with, and in its stead one on Confederate Relations be appointed: for which purpose they report a resolution.</p>
<p>The Committee will now Call the Council's attention to another provision in our permanent Constitution, which did not exist in our former Federal system. The 3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi> Sub. Section of section 10 Article 1. provides that "When any river divides or flows through two or more States they may enter into compacts with each other to improve the navigation thereof." There are three such rivers dividing and flowing through Kentucky and other States -- The Cumberland, Tennesssee and Big Sandy all of which are navigable and navigated. If we should desire to form compacts, with Virginia and Tennessee or either of them, Concerning the navigation of thes rivers a Committee on inter-State Relations would be highly proper, though the duties of such a committee might properly be discharged by the Committee on Confederate Relations</p>
<p>H. W. Bruce

<p>Which reported was received and adopted--<figure type="hr"/></p>

<lb/>Resolved by the Council of the Provisional Government of the State of Kentucky That the Committee on Foreign Relations is hereby dispensed with, and the President of this Council is directed to appoint a committee on Confederate Relations -- 
<lb/>which was adopted<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>Whereupon the President constituted the Committee on Confederate Relations as follows-- Messrs H. W. Bruce Chairman J. W. Moore and J. S. Chrisman
<lb/>And on motion the President W. B. Machen was added to said Committee<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">69</note></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mr Moore</hi> Moved to refer the special message of the Governor in reference to certain resolutions passed by the Legislature of the State of Tennessee to the Committee on Confederate Relations which motion prevailed<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mr Crockett</hi> moved that the vote by which the Council refused to dispense with the rule constitutional provision and third reading of the bill Entitled "an act to provide for the election of Deputies to the Confederate Congress" and the vote being taken on said motion it was decided in the affirmative<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mr Crockett</hi> then offered the following as a substitute for the Original bill viz
<lb/>1 Be it enacted by the Council of the Provisional Government of the State of Kentucky. That said Council elect three deputies to represent the State of Kentucky in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of America. Said Deputies shall be selected one from that portion of the State East of the Kentucky River, another from that portion of the State between the Kentucky and Green Rivers, and the third from that portion South of Green River.
<lb/>Sec. 2. The time of the election shall be fixed by resolution of the Council.
<lb/>The question being put upon the adoption of said substitute it was decided in the negative --

<lb/>Those who voted in the affirmative were Messrs
<lb/>President, Crockett, Bates, and H. W. Bruce 4.
<lb/>Those who voted in the negative were Messrs
<lb/>Thompson, Moore, Burnside, E. M. Bruce and Scott 5.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mr Crockett</hi> then moved that the whole subject be postponed until the <date when="1862-02-22">22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day of February next</date>-- and the question being taken thereon it was decided in the negative.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mr Thompson</hi> moved to postpone the further Consideration of the bill until 10 <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">2</hi> O'Clock on tomorrow and that the same be made the Special order of the day for that hour.
<lb/>Which motion prevailed<figure type="hr"/></p>
