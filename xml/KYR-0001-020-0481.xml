   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner William McKaye -- respectfully states that at the <date when="1861-01">January Term (1861)</date> of the city court of Louisville he was fined fifty dollars for carrying concealed a pistol. He confessed Judgment. He states that the pistol was found on his person, during the Christmas holiday -- that he is not in the habit of carrying concealed weapons, and that no person was injured by reason of his carrying the weapon, and that he did not attempt to injure any person with it. He states that he got the same from his house, and loaded it with powder only and fired it off -- as hundreds of other youngsters were doing at the same time in this city, celebrating Christmas -- and a policemen not friendly with him took it from him, and he was fined. He has paid &#36;15 75. the costs in the prosecution, and that is all he his able to pay -- He respectfully, asks your Excellency to remit said fine &amp; he will ever pray &amp; -- </p>
<p>William McKaye</p>
<p>Louisville <date when="1861-01-14">Jan, 14th 1861</date>.</p>
<p>The petitioner Wm McKaye -- is a young man, we know him well, and believe that a fine should not have been assessed against him under the circumstances as stated in his petition &amp; ask for a remission of the fine.</p>
