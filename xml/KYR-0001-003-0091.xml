   <p>Head-Quarters <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000273">District of Kentucky</orgName>,
<lb/>5TH DIVISION, 23D ARMY CORPS,

<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor</persName> -- </p>
<p>You will soon have drafted men at your disposal for assignment to three years Regiments -- </p>
<p>I recommend that the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009777">26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Veteran Vo</orgName><hi rend="sup">ls</hi> be at once filled up to the Maximum -- It has done Much service, and has received less favors, and far less consideration than any army regiment sent from the state, by the authorities of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName> -- It has fought well, and has behaved itself well in the field, in the camps and in the garrison -- The officers and Men of the Regt. feel that the state authorities have neglected them, and whilst they have concealed it from the public, have expressed it to their<pb/>
<lb/>friends.</p>
<p>The Regiment as you are aware, after enlisting as veterans consolidation with the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00009912">33<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi> Ky.</orgName> Many Men were recruited by the officers of the 26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> and now they number something over 700 men -- </p>
<p>The Regt has been under orders for some days to proceed to the front -- I have detached it by authority until troops can be had to suply its place -- This will give time to drill and decepline the drafted men assigned to it, before going to the front <persName ref="cwgk:N00003696">Col Maxwell</persName> of this Regt is at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000560">Bowling Green</placeName> with four Companies and<persName ref="cwgk:N00003145"> Leut Col Fairleigh</persName> at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville</placeName> with six companies, to either of which place you would much oblige me, and them, and the Regiment by sending what men you can -- </p>
<p>I am Sir Very Respt &amp;C
