   <p>To His excelency <hi rend="str">James F Robertson</hi> Thomas E Bramlett Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the undersigned your petitioners, would most respectfully represent that at the <date when="--03">March term</date> of the Ballard circuit court one H M Garner was <hi rend="str">indicted</hi> tried upon an indictment for a breach of the Peace and fined the Sum of Eighty three dollars, and two weeks confinement in the County Jail. Now the undersigned would farther represent, that Mr Garner is a very young man, and withal as a general rule a law abiding, and orderly walking youth and could not we think have been betrayed into the Commission of the Offence charged but for the presence of unfortunate circumstances of agrevation and excitement. The Offence charged, in the bill of indictment, was committed about the time of the commencement of the unfortunate dificulties which distract our unhappy Country,- a time when legal and moral restraints, were everywhere thrown to the winds and all the evil passions of our nature were turned loose. Mr Garner, being a youth, at the time, and having conducted himself well, before &amp; since the commission of the offence, and with all a poor <hi rend="str">many</hi> man, and <hi rend="str">wholy</hi> wholy unable to pay the fine, we earnestly think his case is one in which the Executive clemency should be extended. An aditinoal reasen for Executive, ^interposition^ is the fact that since the commission of the offence charged, and of which he was convicted, Mr Garner has changed his relations in life, and now has a young family dependent upon him for support, who will be disgraced by his imprisonment, and ^suffer^ great pecuniary embaresment by the rigid enforcement of the law in the<pb/>
<lb/>collection of the fine. For the reasons offered above the undersigned would respectfully ask your Excellency to interpose the prerogative of <hi rend="str">Mr</hi> Mercy as far as the Executive may in relieveing the young man from fine and imprisonment and as in duty will ever pray &amp;c -- </p>
