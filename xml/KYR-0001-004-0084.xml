At the <date when="1863-08">August term 1863</date>, on the first day of court a judgment was entered against then without the knowledge of their counsel, who after it was entered ^&amp; at same term^ moved to set aside the judg under the provisions of sec <gap/> criminal code, Said motion was overruled by the court as it was made too late. As they delivered the prisoner to the sheriff as soon as they learned she had forfeited her bond they pray your Excellency to remit said judgment.</p>
<p>The foregoing statements are substantially true, and as there seems to have been a mistake if it can be propely done, I hope your Excellency will remit-</p>
