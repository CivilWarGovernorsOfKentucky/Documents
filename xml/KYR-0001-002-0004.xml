<lb/>My Dear Gov.</p>
<p>I have just learned from Tyler Alxander that it is probable he will resign his Commission as provost Marshall of this district Some time in <date when="1863-12">Decr next,</date> without inflicting <unclear/> upon you a long and vexatious enumeration of my political claims and services as is usual in such cases, or even making tedious apologies for approaching you upon the subject, I will merely state that as I am now out of Business, and consider myself in many respects peculearly adapted to such<pb/>
<lb/>a position I would be much gratified to get the appointment. I will also say so far as I have heard any expression of opinion upon the subject our people would be thoroughly satisfied with the appointment, In fact it never occured to me to apply for the position until it was suggested to me. As two members of the board are from the most Northern County of the district (Shelby) our County being the farthest south, is certainly entitled to the other one, I hope to see you soon &amp; present <hi rend="underline">many</hi> other considerations which if stated here would perhaps draft too heavily on your time &amp; patience,<pb/>
<lb/>this is only for the purpose of requesting (if Consistent with your feelings and convictions of duty,) that you will not commit yourself to interests of any one else in this matter until I see you.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfly
