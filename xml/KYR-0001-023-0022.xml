<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00000258">Gov. Magoffin
</persName><lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have a favor to ask in behalf of a friend here. It is the appointment of <persName ref="cwgk:N00004927">Thos. D. Wright</persName>, Editor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00010711">National Democrat</orgName>, as one of your aids. He declined a Commission of the same kind from <persName ref="cwgk:N00000830">Gov. Powell</persName> because he thought there would never be any thing to do. But he now believes that in less than six months you may require the actual services of as many of your staff officers as could enter upon active duty<hi rend="str">s</hi> in which event he would like to belong to your staff, and would therefore accept a commission. He is<pb/>
<lb/>a firm friend of your administration and I have no doubt that you would have no cause to regret the appointment.</p>
<p>In justice to him I will say that he did not mention the subject to me but I did to him.</p>
<p>I am confined to my room by sickness and have been Ever since my return from <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>.</p>
<p>I have rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from <persName ref="cwgk:N00010697">Mr. Yancey</persName> a copy of his speech in the African Slave trade, delivered in the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002509">Alabama</placeName> Convention the <date when="1860-10-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Oct</date>. He takes ground against it, viewing it as a question of political Economy, contending that the states Composing the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Confederacy</orgName> will have as much slave labor as will be profitable, and<pb/>
<lb/>he therefore recommends the adoption of a provision in the Constitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves as merchandize from any foreign source whatever. This will prevent Ky &amp; other slave states that refuse to join the Southern <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Confederacy</orgName> from sending their slaves for sale.</p>
<p>From what I can learn since my return this <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000758">County</placeName> is largely for Convention. Mr. Wright will have an Editorial in this weeks paper, severely, but I think justly, Commenting on the proceedings of the recent session of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000923">Legislature</orgName>. Also a reply to <persName ref="cwgk:N00010712">Harvey</persName>'s lamentations over the defeat of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000823">Crittenden</persName> resolutions.</p>
<p>Yours truly
