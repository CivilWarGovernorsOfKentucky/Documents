   <p>To His Excellency the Governor of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName></p>
<p>Your Petitioner<persName ref="cwgk:N00012381"> James A Hunt </persName>states that a Judgement was entered against him in name of the Commonwealth agt James A Hunt before the <persName ref="cwgk:N00002329">Police Judge</persName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000555">Harrodsburg</placeName> for the sum of Thirty Dollars and costs said Judgement was rendered on <date when="1863-09-17">17 Sept 1863</date>. and was for a breach of the Peace.</p>
<p>He states that said breach of the Peace was committed by him whilst Mortified and enraged on account of the degrading and unjustifiable treatment your <persName ref="cwgk:N00012382">petitioners Son </persName>had received at the hands of the person against whom the breach of the peace was committed, that in the excitement of the moment and in <unclear/>obedience to an irresistible impulse of our Common nature he undertook to avenge a cruel wrong suffered by his child; and that though the strict letter of the law would not Justify his Course, yet the feelings of a father and the instincts of true manhood goaded by a sense of grievous wrongs would at least excuse him- Your petitioner further states that he is poor and has a large family and is unable to pay the fine, and for these reasons he asks of Your Excellency the exercise of clemency-</p>
