        <p>Chartered in 1847 to be the first line-haul common carrier railroad to serve Louisville and Jefferson County. Construction began in 1849 by placing rails east of Louisville. The city of Louisville donated $800,000 to the project. Construction completed in 1851. Its principal headquarters were located at the Brook and Jefferson Streets in Louisville, Kentucky. Consolidated with the Lexington &amp; Frankfort Railroad in 1857 to become the Louisville, Frankfort, &amp; Lexington Railroad, which eventually became a division of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad system. Original directors: John J. Jacob, William H. Field, John Hulme, Virgil McKnight, Thomas Smith, and Jacob Swigert. </p>
