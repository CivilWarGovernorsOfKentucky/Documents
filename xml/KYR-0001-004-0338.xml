   <p>To his Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas E Bramlette</persName> Governor of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName> of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001800">Kentucky</placeName>,</p>
<p>We whose names are hereunto Subscribed represent to your Excellency, that at the <date when="1863-12">December term 1863</date> of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000597">Barren Equity &amp; Criminal Court</orgName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00010986">James Bryan </persName>Esq of this county was found guilty by a Jury under an Indictment found by the grand Jury of this County against him of permitting his negro woman Slave <persName ref="cwgk:N00012511">Amelia</persName> to go at large, and hire Herself out; the fine therefor under the statutes of Kentucky being $40,</p>
<p>The Said Bryan is a Batchelor, and is not keeping House, his Said negro woman lived in a House with another family Some 30 Steps from the boarding House of her Owner; and is an exceedingly good, Orderly, and Obedient Old woman, her Owner James<pb/>
<lb/>Bryan is a man distinguished for his honesty and piety far and near,</p>
<p>upon the trial of Said indictment no instance of actual hiring of the Old woman made by her Own Contract was proven; but the evidence was exclusively of a circumstancial character.</p>
<p>No person has been injured, no nuisance has been created, and no family annoyed or interrupted by Said Slave; she was purchased by her Owner as an act of Charity to <persName ref="cwgk:N00012512">her husband</persName>, a good and honest Old negro man to prevent a Separation of man &amp; wife.</p>
<p>We are Satisfied that if the letter of the law has been violated by said Bryan, that its Spirit and re<hi rend="str">a</hi>ason has not been infringed.</p>
<p>There are a number of Circumstances Connected with<pb/>
<lb/>the case which we have not space here to enumerate; all indicating it, as a case that readily deserves the exercise of Executive Clemency in the remission of the fine imposed.</p>
<p>we therefore respectfully recommend, to your excellency the propriety of remitting Said fine against Said James Bryan; who is a good citizen, a loyal man, &amp; useful member of <hi rend="str">s</hi>Society.
