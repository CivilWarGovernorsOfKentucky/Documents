   <p>Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> <persName ref="cwgk:N00012363">Jesse Stevens</persName> states that he has been acquainted with <persName ref="cwgk:N00011764">Thomas B. Wadlington</persName> ever since his boyhood, and has always regarded him as a good honest and law abiding Citizen, and such he believes to be the general opinion of his neighbors</p>
   <p>He states, that on the evening previous to the unfortunate killing of <persName ref="cwgk:N00011760">Cartwright</persName>, and after said Wadlington had learned, that his <persName ref="cwgk:N00011765">son</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00014189">servant</persName> had been driven from their work, he said Wadlington told this affiant about the circumstance of his hands having been driven from their work and in said conversation, Wadlington said he was afraid he would have trouble with Cartwright about it. That he himself wanted to do right about it, but he Cartwright was a dangerous &amp; troublesome young man, and he (Cartwright) had already shot at one man, and he seemed to have serious apprehensions of his own safety, and seemed very much to regret the circumstance of Cartwrights conduct. In said conversation Wadlington did not seem to manifest any anger or bad feeling, but <hi rend="str">on</hi> ^only^ the feeling of regret.</p>
<p>He further states, that he heard the trial, heard the evidence of <persName ref="cwgk:N00013981">Prince</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00013982">Blalock</persName>, and from all he heard and from all that he knows of the whole matter he does firmly believe, that manifest injustice was done to said Wadlington in the verdict of the Jury and he does believe the killing of Cartwright<pb/>
<lb/>was in necessary self defence.</p>
